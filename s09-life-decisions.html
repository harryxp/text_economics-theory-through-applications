        <h2 class="title editable block">Life Choices</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s00_p01">Some economic decisions, like how to spend your money and your time, are everyday decisions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_001">See <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch04#cooperecon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Everyday Decisions"</a> for more discussion.</span> There are also bigger and more difficult economic decisions that you confront only occasionally. In the months and years after graduation, you will face major life choices, such as the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s00_l01">
            <li>Upon graduation, which occupation should you choose?</li>
            <li>Should you go to graduate school?</li>
            <li>Should you purchase a new car?</li>
            <li>Should you purchase a house?</li>
            <li>How much of your income should you save?</li>
            <li>Should you purchase health insurance?</li>
            <li>Should you purchase insurance for your home or apartment?</li>
            <li>What should you do with the money you save?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s00_p02">These economic choices are more complicated than choosing how many chocolate bars to buy or how much time you should spend watching television today.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s00_p03">Two things make these decisions hard. First, there is the element of time—not the 24 hours in a day, but the fact that you must make decisions whose consequences will unfold over time. In choosing an occupation, deciding on graduate school, or picking a portfolio of financial assets, you must look ahead. Second, there is the element of uncertainty. Will you be healthy? Will you live to an old age? Will you succeed as a rock musician? The future is unknown, yet we cannot ignore it. The future is coming whether we like it or not.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s00_p04">We cannot tell you whether you should buy a new car or if you will be a rock star. But we can give you some tools that will help you when you are making decisions that involve time and uncertainty. In this chapter we tackle the following questions:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s00_l02">
            <li>How do we make decisions over time?</li>
            <li>How do we make plans for an uncertain future?</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s00_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Road Map</h3>
            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch05_s00_s01_p01">The chapter is organized around the two themes of time and uncertainty. We begin with a brief review of the choice between two goods at a given time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_002">This decision is analyzed at length in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch04#cooperecon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Everyday Decisions"</a>.</span> Then we look at choices over time. Economists typically assume that individuals are capable of choosing consistently among the bundles of goods and services they might wish to consume. The ability to make such a choice is perhaps not too onerous in the case of simple choices at a given time (such as whether to go to a movie or go to dinner). It is more difficult when we consider choices over a broad range of goods from now into the future.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="cooperecon-ch05_s00_s01_l01">
                <li>There are goods and services that will be available to you in the future that you cannot imagine today. When people chose among different types of handheld calculators 30 years ago, they could not imagine that today they would be choosing among different types of tablet computers. Many products that we now consume simply did not exist in any form until comparatively recently, and when we make choices now, we do so in ignorance of future consumption possibilities.</li>
                <li>Your tastes may change. When you are 20 years old, it is difficult to predict what goods and services you will want to buy when you are 30, 40, or 50 years old. Your future self might regret past decisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch05_s00_s01_p02">We tackle time and uncertainty separately. To begin with, we will suppose that the future is known with certainty. This allows us to focus on including time in our analysis of economic decision making. We begin with a discussion of the choice between consumption and saving and explain how this decision is affected by changes in interest rates. We then look at problems such as how to choose an occupation. A major part of this analysis is an explanation of how to compare income that we receive in different years.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch05_s00_s01_p03">We then turn to uncertainty. We explain the idea of risk and then discuss the kinds of risks you cannot avoid in life. We explain how insurance is a way to cope with these risks. We also discuss uncertainties that we <em class="emphasis">create</em> in our lives—through occupational choice, portfolio choice, and gambling.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Budget Line with Two Periods</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_p01">Now think about what the budget line looks like when we are choosing between now and the future. Just as we find it easier to think about the choice between two goods rather than among 2,000 goods, so too is it easier to think about the choice over only two periods of time. We call these two periods “this year” and “next year.” There is nothing special about the two-period example beyond the fact that it makes it easy to draw diagrams and see what is going on. The principles that we uncover for this case also apply to decisions made with more than two time periods in mind.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_p02">We also do not worry about all the different goods and services that are available, preferring instead to talk in general about consumption this year and consumption next year. We <em class="emphasis">aggregate</em> together all the different products that we consume. Thus “consumption” means the bundle of goods and services people consume. This consumption also has an associated price, which we call the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">price level</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of average prices in an economy.</span></span>. Think of this as the average price of goods and services in the economy. If you find it easier, imagine there is a single good, like chocolate bars, that you consume, and think of the price level as simply being the price of a chocolate bar.</p>
        <div class="section" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Saving and the Nominal Interest Rate</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p01">If you choose not to spend all your income on consumption this year, you are saving. When you save, you can put your money into a financial institution and earn interest on it. Suppose you have $100 this year that you save by putting it in a bank. You are then <em class="emphasis">lending</em> to the bank—saving and lending are really the same thing. The bank acts as an intermediary, taking your $100 and giving it to someone else who borrows from the bank.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p02">The bank offers you interest on this loan—for example, it may pay a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nominal interest rate</a><span class="glossdef">The rate at which individuals and firms in an economy can save or borrow.</span></span> of 5 percent per year. After a year, your bank account will contain your original $100, plus an extra 5 percent. Because 5 percent of $100 is $5, you earn $5 worth of interest. We talk about interest rates in percentage terms, but you should remember that a percentage is simply a number. For example, 5 percent is 0.05, and 20 percent is 0.2. The nominal interest rate is the interest rate at which individuals and firms in the economy can save or borrow.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_003">There are actually many different interest rates in an economy. <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch10#cooperecon-ch10">Chapter 10 "Making and Losing Money on Wall Street"</a> looks at some of these. Here, we simplify the process by supposing there is only one interest rate.</span> It is called a <em class="emphasis">nominal</em> interest rate because it is measured in monetary terms. Most interest rates are quoted on an annual basis, meaning that they specify the amount earned per year.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p03">Of course, if you put a $100 in the bank for one year, then next year you will still have the original $100 as well as the interest you earned. At an interest rate of 5 percent, $100 this year is worth $105 next year. To calculate the <em class="emphasis">total</em> amount of money that you can earn, we simply add one to the nominal interest rate, giving us the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nominal interest factor</a><span class="glossdef">A factor, equal to 1 + the nominal interest rate, used to convert dollars today into dollars next year.</span></span>:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">nominal interest factor = 1 + nominal interest rate.</span></span>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p06">In this chapter, we typically use the nominal interest factor rather than the nominal interest rate because it makes the equations easier to understand. Just keep in mind that it is easy to move back and forth between the interest rate and the interest factor by adding or subtracting one.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p07">If you have $100 today, then tomorrow it will be worth $100 × the nominal interest factor. In general,</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p08">Armed with this idea of the nominal interest factor, we can graph the budget line for a two-period consumption-saving problem. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 5.2 "The Budget Line with Two Periods"</a> shows consumption this year on the horizontal axis and consumption next year on the vertical axis.

                <p class="para">This diagram shows the budget line for an individual choosing consumption over time. The slope of the budget line depends on the price level this year, the price level next year, and the nominal interest factor (= 1 + nominal interest rate). Suppose the price level this year is $9, the price level next year is $10, and the nominal interest rate is 20 percent. Then the slope of the budget line is −(9/10) × 1.2 = −1.08. This means that if you give up 1 unit of consumption this year, you can get 1.08 units next year.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p05">The budget line has a negative slope because—as with the choice between chocolate bars and downloads—you must give one thing up to get another. If you want to consume more in the future, you must be willing to consume less right now. If you want to consume more now, you will have to sacrifice consumption in the future.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p06">The slope of the budget line depends not only on the nominal interest factor but also on prices this year and next year. Suppose the price of a unit of consumption this year is $100 and next year it is $110. Economists call the percentage increase in the price level the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inflation rate</a><span class="glossdef">The rate at which the overall price level in an economy is growing.</span></span>; it is calculated as follows:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p07">Put differently, it is the rate of growth of the price level. In our example, the inflation rate is 10 percent.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p08">Now suppose the nominal interest rate is also 10 percent, which means that the nominal interest factor is 1.1. Then</p>

In fact, it depends on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">real interest factor</a><span class="glossdef">A factor, equal to 1 + the real interest rate, that allows you to convert units of goods and services this year into units of goods and services next year.</span></span>:</p>

Your contract with the bank thus stipulates that you must pay the bank $21,000 at the end of the year. If the inflation rate is zero, then the cost of borrowing measured in terms of real goods and services is $1,000, which is 5 percent of the amount that you borrowed. But if the inflation rate is 5 percent, then the $21,000 you pay to the bank at the end of the loan buys the same amount of goods and services that the $20,000 the bank lent to you. In this case, you are effectively able to borrow for free.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p13">Good decisions about borrowing and lending are based on real interest rates rather than nominal interest rates. Your cost of borrowing to buy the car is not the monetary payments you make on the loan but rather the value of the goods and services you could have purchased with that money. So we need a way to convert from the commonly observed nominal interest rate to a measure of real interest rates. We do this by using a formula for the real interest rate that was discovered by a famous economist named Irving Fisher.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p01">Interestingly, the timing of your income turns out not to matter for your choice of consumption, which is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s01_s03_s02_f01">Figure 5.6 "The Timing of Income"</a>.</p>

                <p class="para">The timing of income is irrelevant to the consumption choice. Here, one individual has low income this year and high income next year, while the opposite is true for the other individual. However, the discounted present value of income is the same in both cases. If they both have the same tastes, they will choose the same consumption point.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p02">Suppose that the nominal interest rate is 10 percent and that the price level is $10 in both periods. This means that the inflation rate is zero, so—from the Fisher equation—the real interest rate is also 10 percent. Now imagine that there are two individuals who have identical tastes. One of them earns income of $40,000 this year and $22,000 next year, so real income (nominal income divided by the price level) is therefore 4,000 this year and 2,200 next year. The other person earns $20,000 this year and $44,000 next year, yielding a real income of 2,000 this year and 4,400 next year. Both of these individuals share the same budget line (see <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s01_s03_s02_f01">Figure 5.6 "The Timing of Income"</a>). This is because the discounted present value of their nominal income is the same: $60,000. (Check to make sure you understand why this is true.) For example, suppose that the preferred point of both individuals is to consume the same amount in each year. Then they can both consume approximately 3,143 units of consumption in each period.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p03">Let us see how this works. Because the price level is $10, this amount of consumption costs $31,430 in each period. The first individual takes her income of $40,000 and saves $8,570 by putting it in the bank. This saving earns 10 percent interest, so she gets an additional $857. She thus has income in the following year equal to $22,000 + $8,570 + $857 = $31,427. This allows her to buy 3,142.7 units of consumption goods. The second individual needs to borrow $11,430 to add to his income this year. Next year, he must repay this amount plus 10 percent interest (that is, another $1,143). So his income next year is $44,000 − $11,430 − $1,143 = $31,427. So one individual must save to reach her preferred consumption bundle, while the other must borrow to reach his. Yet because they have the same discounted present value of income and the same tastes, they will consume the same bundle of goods.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p04">Keep in mind that our discussion so far ignores uncertainty. We assumed that both individuals know their current and future income with certainty. Just as importantly, we have supposed that a bank is confident that the borrower will have sufficient income next year to repay the loan. In a world of uncertainty, we do not know for sure how much money we will have next year, and lenders worry about the possibility that people might not make good on their loans. Later in the chapter, we explain more about decision making in an uncertain world.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Lifetime Budget Constraint</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p01">So far, we have worked everything out in terms of a two-period example. The two-period budget constraint tells us how income and consumption are linked over time. In reality, of course, you make these decisions with longer time horizons, and you can save or borrow for multiple years. But the same fundamental insight holds. If you save this year, then you will have extra resources to spend at some future date. If you borrow this year, then you will have to repay that loan sometime in the future, at which time you will have fewer resources to spend.</p>
        <div class="callout block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_n01">
            <h3 class="title"></h3>
            <p class="simpara">Toolkit: <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch31_s04#cooperecon-ch31_s04" xrefstyle="select:title">Section 31.4 "Choices over Time"</a></p>
            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p02">Individuals face a lifetime budget constraint. They can save in some periods of their lives and borrow (not save) in other periods. Over the course of any individual’s lifetime, however, income and consumption spending must balance. (If you begin life with some assets [for example, a bequest], we count this as part of income. If you leave a bequest when you die, we count this as part of consumption.) The lifetime budget constraint is as follows:</p>
            <span class="informalequation"><span class="mathphrase">discounted present value of lifetime consumption = discounted present value of lifetime income.</span></span>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p03">Again, it is important to be consistent in calculating the discounted present values in this expression. We have written the equation in terms of (real) consumption and (real) income, which means that the real interest factor must be used for discounting. An alternative is to measure both consumption and income in nominal terms and then use the nominal interest factor for discounting. There is a useful special case where real interest rates are zero, in which case it <em class="emphasis">is</em> legitimate simply to add income and consumption in different years. Thus the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lifetime budget constraint</a><span class="glossdef">The discounted present value of lifetime consumption must equal the discounted present value of lifetime income.</span></span> becomes</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">total lifetime consumption = total lifetime income.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p04">Although the principles of decision making are the same whether we are thinking about 2 months, 2 years, or an entire lifetime, it is obviously harder to make decisions over a 30-year horizon than over a 30-day horizon. One reason is that, over longer time horizons, we are more likely to face uncertainty. We don’t know what our income will be 30 years from now, and we don’t know our tastes. But even without that uncertainty, we may not always make good decisions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p05">In particular, economists and psychologists have discovered that we do not view choices involving the near future the same way as we view distant choices. For example, suppose an individual is given a choice between 1 cookie today or 2 cookies tomorrow. If he is impatient (or hungry), he is likely to choose the single cookie today. But if the same individual is given a choice between 1 cookie in 30 days or 2 cookies in 31 days, he or she may very well choose the 2-cookie option. Yet after 30 days have gone by, that person will be confronting the earlier decision, wishing that he or she could have the 2 cookies today.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p06">Another way of saying this is that our decisions are not always consistent over time: our future selves may wish that our current selves had displayed more self-control. For example, we may choose to consume a lot today—instead of saving—and then regret that decision when we are older. Indeed, people often engage in tricks to get around their lack of self-control. For example, some people have a separate bank account for their savings, so they are less tempted to spend that money. Governments also take actions that compensate for our lack of self-control. Social security is in some ways a “forced saving” scheme: the government takes money from us when we are working but pays us money when we are retired.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p07">There is a new and exciting field of economics called “neuroeconomics” that tries to understand the processes in the brain that underlie economic decision making. This field, while still very much in its infancy, promises to help us understand why the economic theory of how we make choices often works well, and why it sometimes does not. Some recent research suggests that different brain processes may deliver conflicting messages when making choices over time. Some processes are deliberative, in line with the economic model, while others are more impulsive. It is likely that the next two decades will bring a much deeper understanding of how the brain makes decisions, perhaps leading to a richer theory of economic decision making.</p>

The budget line becomes steeper because the opportunity cost of consumption this year increases. Notice, though, that the point at which you just consume your income in each period is still on the budget line. This is the point at which you are neither saving nor borrowing. Thus no matter what the interest rate, this point is always available to you.</p>

To the right of the income point, the new budget line lies inside the old budget set. This encourages borrowers to decrease consumption this year and next year.

In the first year in your career as a lawyer, we suppose that you work as a clerk, not earning very much. In the second year, you join a law firm and enjoy much higher pay. Selling insurance pays better than the legal career in the first year but worse in the second year. Working as a barista pays less than selling insurance in both years.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s01_p03">It is obvious that, if you care about the financial aspect of your career, you should not be a barista. (You would choose that career only if it had other benefits—such as flexible working hours and lack of stress—that outweighed the financial penalty.) It is less obvious whether it is better financially to work as a lawyer or as an insurance salesperson. Over the two years, you earn $65,000 as a lawyer and $63,000 as an insurance seller. But as we have already explained, simply adding your income for the two years is incorrect. The high salary you earn as a lawyer comes mostly in the second year and must be discounted back to the present.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s01_p04">To properly compare these careers, you should use the tool of discounted present value. With this tool, you can compare the income flows from the different occupations. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s02_s01_t02">Table 5.3 "Comparing Discounted Present Values of Different Income Streams"</a> shows the discounted present value of the two-year flow of income for each career, assuming a 5 percent interest rate (that is, an interest factor equal to 1.05). Look, for example, at the lawyer’s income stream:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><math xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xml:id="fwk-cooperecon-05_m0015" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>discounted present value of income as a lawyer = $5,000 + </mtext><mfrac><mrow><mtext>$60,000</mtext> </mrow><mrow><mtext>1</mtext><mtext>.05</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac><mo>=</mo><mi>$</mi><mn>62.143.</mn></mrow> </semantics></math></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s01_p05">Similarly, the discounted present value of the income stream is $61,286 for the insurance salesperson and $37,048 for the barista. So if you are choosing your career on the basis of the discounted present value of your income stream, you should pick a career as a lawyer.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s01_p06">This conclusion, however, depends on the interest rate used for discounting. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s02_s01_t03">Table 5.4 "Discounted Present Values with Different Interest Rates"</a> adds another column, showing the discounted present values when the interest rate is 10 percent. You can see two things from this table: (1) The higher interest rate reduces the discounted present value for all three professions. If the interest rate increases, then future income is less valuable in present value terms. (2) The higher interest rate reverses our conclusion about which career is better. Selling insurance now looks better than being a lawyer because most of the lawyer’s earnings come in the future, so the discounting has a bigger effect.</p>

This evidently would have higher income. Sadly, it is not possible: it is almost impossible to qualify for a high-paying lawyer’s job without investing a year as a law clerk first. Changing occupation can be very costly or even impossible if you don’t have the right skills. So choosing a career path means you must look ahead.</p>

You have chosen to go to college rather than taking a job immediately after graduating from high school. Ignoring the pleasures of going to college—and there are many—there are direct financial costs and benefits of a college education.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s02_p02">Think back to when you were deciding whether to go to college or to start work immediately. To keep our example from being too complicated, we again look at a two-year decision. What if you could obtain a college degree in one year, at a tuition cost of $13,000, and the interest rate is 5 percent annually? Your earnings are presented in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s02_s02_t01">Table 5.5 "Income from Going to College versus Taking a Job"</a>. In your year at college, you would earn no income, and you have to pay the tuition fee. In the following year, imagine that you can earn $62,143 working as a lawyer. Alternatively, you could bypass college and go to work as a barista, earning $10,000 in the first year and $37,048 in the second year. (We are assuming, as before, that you know these figures with certainty when you are making your decision.)</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s02_p03">Going to college is an example of an <em class="emphasis">investment decision</em>. You incur a cost in the year when you go to college, and then you get a benefit in the future. There are two costs of going to college: (1) the $13,000 tuition you must pay (this is what you probably think of first when considering the cost of going to college) and (2) the <em class="emphasis">opportunity cost</em> of the income you could have earned while working. In our example, this is $10,000. The explicit cost and the opportunity cost together total $23,000, which is what it costs you to go to college instead of working in the first year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s02_p04">By the way, we do <em class="emphasis">not</em> think about living expenses as a cost of going to college. You have to pay for food and accommodation whether you are at college or working. Of course, if these living expenses are different under the two scenarios, then you should take this into account. For example, if your prospective college is in New York City and has higher rental costs than in the city where you would work, then the <em class="emphasis">difference</em> in the rent should be counted as another cost of college.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s02_p05">The benefit of going to college is the higher future income that you enjoy. In our example, you will earn $62,143 in the following year if you go to college, and $37,048 if you do not. The difference between these is the benefit of going to college: $62,143 − $37,048 = $25,095. Even though this is greater than the $23,000 cost of going to college, we cannot yet conclude that going to college is a good idea. We have to calculate the discounted present value of this benefit.

Krueger, an economics professor at Princeton, says the evidence suggests that, up to a point, an additional year of schooling is likely to raise an individual’s earnings about 10 percent. For someone earning the national median household income of $42,000, an extra year of training could provide an additional $4,200 a year. Over the span of a career, that could easily add up to $30,000 or $40,000 of present value. If the year’s education costs less than that, there is a net gain.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_006">Anna Bernasek, “What’s the Return on Education?” Economic View, Business Section, <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, December 11, 2005, accessed February 24, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/business/yourmoney/11view.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/business/yourmoney/11view.html</a>.</span> Notice several things from this passage. First, the gains from education appear as an increase in earnings <em class="emphasis">each year</em>. So even if a 10 percent increase in earnings does not seem like a lot, it can be substantial once these gains are added over one’s lifetime. Second, Krueger is careful to use the term <em class="emphasis">present value</em>. Third, the number given is an average. Some people will benefit more; others will benefit less. Equally, some forms of schooling will generate larger income gains than others. Fourth, Krueger correctly notes that the present value must be compared with the cost of education, but you should remember that the cost of education includes the opportunity cost of lost income.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s02_p14">The presence of such apparently large gains from education helps explain why economists often suggest that education is one of the most important ingredients for the development of poorer countries. (In poorer countries, we are often talking not about the benefit of going to college but about the benefit of more years of high school education.) Moreover, the benefits from education typically go beyond the benefits to the individuals who go to school or college. There are benefits to society as a whole as well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s02_p15">However, you should be careful when interpreting numbers such as these. We cannot conclude that if you randomly selected some high school graduates and sent them to college, then their income would increase by $17,000. As we all understand, individuals <em class="emphasis">decide</em> whether to go to college. These decisions reflect many things, including general intelligence, the ability to apply oneself to a task, and so on. People who have more of those abilities are more likely to attend—and complete—college.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s02_p16">One last point: we conducted this entire discussion “ignoring the pleasures of going to college.” But those pleasures belong in the calculations. Economics is about not only money but also all the things that make us happy. This is why we occasionally see people 60 years old or older in college. They attend not as an investment but simply because of the pleasure of learning. This is not inconsistent with economic reasoning or our discussion here. It is simply a reminder that your calculations should not only be financial but also include the all the nonmonetary things you care about.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s03_p01">After you have decided whether or not to go to college and have chosen your career, you will still have plenty of decisions to make involving discounted present value. Remember that you have a lifetime budget constraint, in which the discounted present value of your income, including labor income, equals the discounted present value of consumption.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s03_p02">Your labor income is partly under your control. If you have some choice about how many hours to work, then your <strong class="emphasis bold">individual labor supply curve</strong> depends on the real wage, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s02_s03_f01">Figure 5.10 "Individual Labor Supply"</a>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_008"><a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch04#cooperecon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Everyday Decisions"</a> explains the individual supply of labor.</span> The labor supply curve illustrates the fact that as the real wage increases, you are likely to work more. Labor supply, like the supply of loans that we considered previously, is driven by substitution and income effects. As the real wage increases,</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s03_p04">When you are making a decision about how much to work over many periods of time, your choice is more complicated. How much you choose to work right now depends not only on the real wage today but also on the real wage in the future and on the real interest rate. This is because you work both today and in the future to earn the income that goes into your lifetime budget constraint. If you think it is likely to be harder to earn money in the future, then you will probably decide to work more today. If you think it will be easier to earn money in the future, then you might well decide to work less today.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s03_p05">It is easiest to see how this works with an example. Suppose you are a freelance construction worker in Florida in the aftermath of a hurricane. There is lots of work available, and construction firms are paying higher than usual wages. You realize that you can earn much more per hour of work right now compared to your likely wage a few months in the future. A natural response is to work harder now to take advantage of the unusually high wages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s03_p06">We can understand your decision in terms of income and substitution effects. The higher wage leads to the usual substitution effect. But because the change in the wage is only temporary, and because you are thinking about your wages over your lifetime, it does not have a large income effect. In this case, therefore, we expect the substitution effect to strongly outweigh the income effect.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s03_p07">Interest rates may also influence your decision about how hard to work. If interest rates increase, then the gains from working today increase as well. If you save money at high interest rates, you can enjoy more consumption in the future. High interest rates, like temporarily high current wages, increase the return to working today compared to working in the future, so you are likely to work more today.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Demand for Durable Goods</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s04_p01">Some of the products we purchase, such as milk or a ticket to a football game, disappear as soon as they are consumed. Other goods last for a long time and are, in effect, consumed over and over. Some examples are a bicycle, a car, and a microwave oven.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s04_p02">Goods that last over many uses are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">durable goods</a><span class="glossdef">Goods that last over many uses.</span></span>, while those that do not last very long are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nondurable goods</a><span class="glossdef">Goods that do not last very long.</span></span>. There is no hard-and-fast distinction between durable and nondurable goods. Many everyday items, such as plates, books, T-shirts, and downloaded music, are used multiple times. In economic statistics, however, the term <em class="emphasis">durable</em> is reserved for larger items that are bought only occasionally and that typically last for many years. Cars and kitchen appliances are classified as durable goods, but blue jeans and haircuts are not, even though they are not consumed all at once.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s04_p03">Because durable goods last a long time, making decisions about purchasing a durable good requires thinking about the future as well as the present. You must compare the benefits of the durable good <em class="emphasis">over its entire lifetime</em> relative to the cost you incur to pay for the durable now. A durable good purchase is typically a <strong class="emphasis bold">unit demand</strong> decision—you buy either a single unit or nothing. For unit demand, your decision rule is simple: buy if your <strong class="emphasis bold">valuation</strong> of the good exceeds the price of the good. (Remember that your valuation is the maximum you would be willing to pay for the good.) In the case of durable goods, there is an extra twist: your valuation needs to be a discounted present value.</p>
        <div class="callout block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s04_n01">
            <h3 class="title"></h3>
            <p class="simpara">Toolkit: <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch31_s01#cooperecon-ch31_s01" xrefstyle="select:title">Section 31.1 "Individual Demand"</a></p>
            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s04_p04">You can review valuation and unit demand in the toolkit.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s04_p05">The idea is that you obtain a <em class="emphasis">flow of services</em> from a durable good. You need to place a valuation on that flow for the entire lifetime of the durable good. Then you need to calculate the discounted present value of that flow of services. If this discounted present value exceeds the price of the good, you should purchase it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s04_p06">Suppose you are thinking of buying a new car that you expect to last for 10 years. You need to place a valuation on the flow of services that you get from the car each year: for example, you might decide that you are willing to pay $3,000 each year for the benefit of owning the car. To keep life really simple, let us think about a situation where the real interest rate is zero; this is the special case where it <em class="emphasis">is</em> legitimate to add these flows. So the car is worth $30,000 (= $3,000 per year × 10 years) to you now. This means you should be willing to buy the car if it costs less than $30,000, and you should not buy it otherwise.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_009">What if you think you might sell the car before it wears out? In this case, the value of the car has two components: (1) the flow of services you obtain while you own it, and (2) the price you can expect to obtain when you sell it. When you buy a durable good, you are purchasing an <strong class="emphasis bold">asset</strong>: something that yields some flow of benefits over time and that you can buy and sell. In general, the value of an asset depends on both the benefits that it provides and the price at which it can be traded. We examine these ideas in much more detail in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch10#cooperecon-ch10">Chapter 10 "Making and Losing Money on Wall Street"</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s04_p07">If real interest rates are not zero, then spending on durable goods will depend on interest rates. As interest rates increase, the future benefits of the durable good become smaller, in terms of discounted present value. This means that durable goods become more expensive relative to nondurable goods. Thus the demand for durable goods decreases as interest rates increase.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s04_p08">One way to understand this is to realize that it is often easy to defer the purchase of a durable good. New durable goods are frequently bought to replace old goods that are wearing out. People buy new cars to replace their old cars or new washing machines to replace their old ones. If interest rates are high, you can often postpone such replacement purchases; you decide whether you can manage another year with your old car or leaking washing machine. As a result, spending on durable goods tends to be very sensitive to changes in interest rates.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s02_s04_p09">These examples of discounted present value illustrate one key point: whenever you are making economics decisions about the future—be it what career to follow, when it is best to work hard, or if you should buy a new car—your decisions depend on the rate of interest. Whenever the rate of interest is high, future costs and benefits are substantially discounted and are therefore worth less in present value terms. High interest rates, in other words, mean that you put a lot of weight on the present relative to the future. When the rate of interest decreases, the future should play a larger role in your decisions.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_p02">In life, there are many uncertainties. So far, we have ignored them all, but you will have to face them. In our various discussions of discounted present value, we pretended that you knew your future income—and your future tastes—with certainty. In real life, we must decide how much to save without knowing for sure what our future income will be. We must pick a career without knowing how much we will enjoy different jobs or how much they will pay. We must decide whether or not to go to college without knowing what kind of job we will be able to get, and so on. How can we deal with all these uncertainties?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_p03">Some of the uncertainties we face are forced on us with no choice of our own, such as the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_l02">
        <li>Accidents involving you, your automobile, your house, and so on</li>
        <li>Layoffs resulting in spells of unemployment</li>
        <li>Your health</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_p04">As you know, one way to deal with these uncertain events is through insurance. Insurance is a way of trying to remove some of the risk that we face. We explain how it works later in this section.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_p05">Other risks are more under our control. We accept jobs that entail certain risks. We drive our cars even though we know that there is a risk of accident. We put our savings into risky stocks rather than safe assets. In these cases, we trade off these risks against other benefits. We drive faster, accepting the greater risk of accident to save time. Or we take a risky job because it pays well.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_p06">There are yet other kinds of risk that we actually seek out rather than avoid. We play poker or bet on sporting events. We climb mountains, go skydiving, and engage in extreme sports. In these cases, the risks are apparently something good that we seek out, rather than something bad that we avoid.</p>

(Here we will use the terms more or less interchangeably, although people sometimes reserve the term <em class="emphasis">uncertainty</em> for cases where it is hard to quantify the risks that we face.) Probably the simplest example of risk is familiar to us all: the toss of a coin. Imagine flipping a coin five times. Each time, the outcome will be either a head or a tail. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s03_s01_t01">Table 5.8 "Coin-Flipping Experiment"</a> shows an example of such an experiment.

The outcome reported in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s03_s01_t01">Table 5.8 "Coin-Flipping Experiment"</a> is only one example.

Even if you have 100 heads in a row, this does not affect the outcome of the 101st toss of the coin. If you think that the coin is “fair,” meaning that heads and tails are equally likely, then the 101st toss is still just as likely to be heads as tails.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Financial Risk and Expected Value</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s02_p01">Some of the risks that we confront are nonfinancial. An example of nonfinancial uncertainty is the risk that you might break your ankle playing basketball or the possibility that your favorite sporting team will win a big game and make you happy. Here, we will focus on financial uncertainty, by which we mean situations where there is money at stake. In other words, we are thinking about risks where you can measure the implications in monetary terms. An obvious example is the money you could win or lose from buying a lottery ticket or playing poker. Another is the money you would have to pay for repairs or medical expenses following a car accident. Another is the gains or losses from buying stocks, government bonds, or other financial assets. Another is the income you would lose if you were laid off from your job.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s02_p02">When we evaluate risky situations, we must have a way of describing the kinds of gambles that we confront. In general, we do this by listing all the possible outcomes together with the likelihood of each outcome.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s02_p10">Thus for your investment of $1,000, you could expect to get $2,000 back on average. This seems like a good investment. It is important to remember, though, what “on average” means. You will never actually <em class="emphasis">get</em> $2,000. You will receive either $16,000, $1,000, or nothing. Even though this is a good investment on average, you might still decide that you don’t want any part of it. Yes, you might get the big net gain of $15,000. But there’s also a 50 percent chance that you will be out $1,000. The gamble might seem too risky for you.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s02_p11">Coin tosses are special because it is relatively easy to determine the probability of a head or a tail. This is not the case for all the types of uncertainty you might face. In some cases, financial instruments—such as the mortgage-backed securities that played a big role in the financial crisis of 2007–2009—are so complex that investors find it difficult to assess the probabilities of various outcomes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s02_p12">We often do a bad job of <em class="emphasis">estimating</em> probabilities. One reason for this is because we are unduly influenced by things that we can easily bring to mind. Psychologists call this the “availability heuristic.” For example, we tend to overestimate certain causes of death, such as car accidents, tornadoes, and homicides, and underestimate others, such as diabetes, stroke, and asthma.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_010">See Paul Slovic, Baruch Fischoff, and Sarah Lichtenstein, “Facts versus Fears: Understanding Perceived Risk,” in <em class="emphasis">Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases</em>, ed. Daniel Kahneman, Paul Slovic, and Amos Tversky (Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1982), 463–89.</span> We also often do a poor job at <em class="emphasis">using</em> probabilities; in particular, we often put too much emphasis on small probabilities. For example, consider two drugs that are equally effective in treating a disease, but suppose the older drug has a 1 in 10 million chance of having a certain side effect and the newer drug has a 1 in a 100 million chance of having the same side effect. Consumers might view the new drug as much more appealing, even though the side effect was already highly improbable with the older drug.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Diversification of Risk</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s03_p01">In many cases, we would like to find some way of getting rid of—at least to some degree—the risks that we face. One way we eliminate risk is through insurance. Sometimes we purchase insurance on the market. Sometimes our employer provides us with insurance. Sometimes the government provides us with insurance. In the following subsections, we look at many different kinds of insurance, including property insurance, unemployment insurance, and deposit insurance.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_011">We do not discuss health insurance here. In <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch16#cooperecon-ch16">Chapter 16 "A Healthy Economy"</a>, we discuss the provision of health care and the problems of health insurance in detail.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s03_p02">First, though, we need to understand how and why insurance works. Suppose you have a bicycle worth $1,000, and (for some reason) you cannot purchase insurance. You think that, in any given year, there is about a 1 percent chance that your bike will have to be replaced (because it is either stolen or written off in an accident).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s03_p03">Now, in expected value terms, this may not look too bad. Your expected loss from an accident is $0.01 × $1,000 = $10. So on average, you can expect to lose $10 a year. But the problem is that, if you are unlucky, you are stuck with a very big expense. Most of us dislike this kind of risk.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s03_p04">You are complaining about this to a friend, and she sympathizes, saying that she faces exactly (and we mean exactly) the same problem. She also has a bike worth $1,000 and thinks there is a 1 percent chance each year that she will need to replace it. And that’s when you have the brilliant idea. <em class="emphasis">You can make an agreement that, if either one of you has to replace your bikes, you will share the costs</em>. So if you have to replace your bike, she will pay $500 of your costs, and if she has to replace her bike, then you will pay $500 of her costs. It is (almost exactly) twice as likely that you will have to pay <em class="emphasis">something</em>, but if you do, you will only have to pay half as much. With this scheme, your expected loss is unchanged. But you and your friend prefer this scheme because it is less risky; it is much less likely that you will have to make the big $1,000 payout.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s03_p05">We are implicitly assuming here that your chances of having to replace your bike are independent of the chance that she will have to replace her bike. (If you are likely to crash into her, or both of your bikes are stolen, then it is a different story.) There is also still a chance that you will both experience the unlucky 1-in-100 chance, in which case you would both still have to pay $1,000. But the likelihood of this happening is now tiny. (To be precise, the probability of both of you having an accident in the same year is 1 in 10,000 [that is, 0.0001]). This is because the probability that two independent events occur equals the probability of one multiplied by the probability of the other.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s03_p06">But why stop here? If you can find two more friends with the same problem, then you can make it almost certain that you will have to pay out no more than $250. It is true that you would be even more likely to have to make a payment because you will have to pay if you or one of your friends has to replace his or her bike. But because the payment is now being shared four ways, you will have to pay only 25 percent of the expenses. This is an example of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">diversification</a><span class="glossdef">The insight that underlies insurance in which people can share their risks.</span></span>, which is the insight that underlies insurance: people share their risks, so it is less likely that any single individual will face a large loss.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s03_p07">Diversification and insurance don’t prevent bad stuff from happening. We live in a world where bicycles are stolen; where houses are destroyed by floods, fires, or storms; where people have accidents or become ill; and so on. There is not a lot we can do about the fact that bad things happen. But we can make the consequences of these bad things easier to deal with. Insurance is a means of sharing—diversifying—these risks.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s03_p08">Continuing with our bicycle insurance example, suppose you could find thousands of friends who would agree to be part of this arrangement. As more and more people join the scheme, it becomes increasingly likely that you have to make a payment each year, but the amount you would have to pay becomes smaller and smaller. With a very large number of people, you would end up very close to a situation where you pay out $10 with certainty each year. Of course, organizing thousands of your friends into such a scheme would present all sorts of practical problems. This is where insurance companies come in.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s03_p09">Insurance companies charge you a premium (an annual payment). In return, they promise to pay you an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">indemnity</a><span class="glossdef">In an insurance contract, a value equal to the full amount of the loss minus the deductible.</span></span> in the event you suffer a loss. The indemnity is usually not the full amount of the loss. The part of the loss that is not covered is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">deductible</a><span class="glossdef">In an insurance contract, the value not covered in the event of a loss.</span></span>. In our example, there is no deductible, and the indemnity is $1,000. An insurance company would charge you a premium equal to the expected loss of $10 plus a little extra. The extra payment is how the insurance company makes money. You and everyone else are willing to pay this extra amount in return for the removal of risk.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s03_p10">The idea of diversification can also be applied to investment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_012">We discuss this in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch10#cooperecon-ch10">Chapter 10 "Making and Losing Money on Wall Street"</a>.</span> Think back to our example of your friend with the Internet venture. You might not want to invest $1,000 in his scheme because it seems too risky. But if you had 100 friends with 100 similar (but independent) schemes, you might be willing to invest $10 in each. Again, you would be diversifying your risk.</p>

In our example, you have a 1 percent chance of suffering a $1,000 loss. Your expected loss is therefore $10. Now imagine we give you a choice between this gamble and a certain loss of $10. If you are just as happy in either case, then we say you are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">risk-neutral</a><span class="glossdef">Being willing to pay only the expected loss from a gamble.</span></span>.

You might pay $1,000 per year as a premium for an insurance policy. If your house burns down, then the insurance company will pay you some money to recover <em class="emphasis">part</em> of the loss. If the deductible on the policy is $20,000, you would receive an indemnity of $100,000. You lose $20,000 when the house burns down because the insurance company does not fully cover your loss.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s04_s01_p03">Thus, if your house burns down, the insurance company loses the indemnity minus the premium—a total of $99,000. You lose the deductible and the premium—a total of $21,000. Your joint loss is $120,000—the lost value of the house. This serves to remind us again that insurance is not some magic way of preventing bad things from happening. When the house does not burn down, the insurance company earns the $1,000 premium, and you pay the $1,000 premium. Your joint loss is zero in this case.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s04_s01_p04">You may wonder why insurance companies typically insist on a deductible as part of an insurance contract. After all, you would probably prefer to be covered for the entire loss. Deductibles exist because insurance policies can have the effect of altering how people behave. We have assumed that the probability of a bad thing happening was completely random. But if you are fully insured, you might not be so careful about how you look after your house. You might worry less about turning off the stove, ensuring that you have put out the fire in the fireplace, falling asleep while smoking, and so on. Deductibles make sure that you still have a big incentive to take care of your property.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s04_s02_p03">Since 1960, the unemployment rate in the United States has averaged slightly under 6 percent. This means that for every 100 people in the labor force (either working or looking for a job), 94 of them are working, and the other 6 are looking for jobs. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">labor market</a><span class="glossdef">Where suppliers and demanders of labor meet and trade.</span></span> is fluid so that, over time, unemployed workers find jobs, while some employed workers lose jobs and become unemployed. The unemployed find jobs, and others lose them and go through spells of unemployment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s04_s02_p04">If you are laid off from your job and become unemployed, you obviously still need to spend money for food and rent. During a spell of unemployment, you have several possible sources of income. If you have an existing stock of accumulated savings, then you can draw on these. If you are a member of a union, you may receive some support from the union. You may receive some severance pay when you lose your job. You might be able to rely on the support of your family and friends. And, most relevant for this chapter, you may be eligible to receive income from the government, called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">unemployment insurance</a><span class="glossdef">A payment made by the government to those who are unemployed.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s04_s02_p05">Unemployment insurance is similar in some ways to health and property insurance. There is an unlucky event called unemployment, and the government provides insurance. Perhaps you think this is great news: after graduation, you can claim unemployment, collect from the government, and enjoy your leisure. Of course, life is not quite that good. First, to qualify for unemployment insurance, you have to hold a job for some period of time. The details of these regulations differ across countries and also across states within the United States. Second, unemployment benefits do not last forever, nor do they completely compensate for all of your lost income. Again, the details depend on the country or state in which you work.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s04_s02_p06">Why is the government in the business of providing insurance? To answer this, look back at our example of home insurance. The typical insurance company will have many policies with many different households. Over the course of a year, some households will make a claim on their insurance, but most will not. As long as the insurance company has lots of policies in many locations, then, on average, the number of insurance claims will be nearly constant each year. Although individual households face risk, the insurance company is able to diversify almost all of this risk.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s04_s02_p07">Unemployment is different. When the economy is doing well, unemployment is low, and few households need this form of insurance. When the economy is not doing well, then the unemployment rate can be very high. In such times, many people want to claim unemployment insurance <em class="emphasis">at the same time</em>. So unlike insurance policies for homeowners, there is no easy way to balance out the risks of unemployment. The risk of unemployment is not <em class="emphasis">independent</em> across all individuals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s04_s02_p08">If an individual insurance company tried to offer unemployment insurance, it might be unable to survive: during a period of low economic activity, the demands for insurance would be so severe that the insurance company might not be able to meet all the claims. The government has the ability to tax people and borrow as needed. This puts it in a much better position to offer unemployment insurance. So in many countries, the government raises revenue by taxing firms and workers and uses these funds to provide unemployment insurance.</p>

        <div class="section" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s04_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Deposit Insurance</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s04_s03_p01">In the United States and in some other countries, deposits that you place in the bank are insured by the government. In the United States, the government provides insurance, up to $250,000 per deposit, to you in the event your bank closes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_013">You can find details at FDIC, “Your Insured Deposits,” accessed March 14, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/insured/basics.html">http://www.fdic.gov/deposit/deposits/insured/basics.html</a>.</span> Deposit insurance in the United States dates from the time of the Great Depression in the 1930s. In this period many banks had insufficient funds on hand to meet the demands of their depositors and so went bankrupt. When this occurred, depositors lost the money they had put in the bank. After the Great Depression, the US federal government instituted deposit insurance. Similar programs exist in most other countries.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s04_s03_p02">The argument for why the government should provide deposit insurance is similar to the argument for government provision of unemployment insurance. During periods of financial turbulence, many banks are prone to failure. If there were a private insurance company providing deposit insurance, it would probably be unable to meet all the claims. In addition, there is considerable social value to deposit insurance. It gives people greater confidence in the bank and in the banking system, which in turn makes bank failures less likely. Because bank failures put a great deal of stress on the financial system, government has an interest in insuring deposits.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s03_s04_s03_p03">In the summer of 2007, the British bank Northern Rock entered a financial crisis. Savers who had put their money in this institution started to worry that the bank would go bust, in which case they would lose their money. The British government, like the US government, provides deposit insurance. However, the amount of this insurance was limited to a maximum of about $70,000, so some people were still concerned about their savings. As lines started to form outside Northern Rock branches, the British government—concerned that the possible failure of Northern Rock would put other banks at risk—ended up guaranteeing all of its deposits.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_p02">Insurance allows us to remove some risks from our lives, either partially or completely. There are other risks that we accept or even embrace. In some cases, we are willing to take on risks because we are compensated in some way for them. We discuss two examples here: job choice and investment in the stock market. In other cases, we actively seek risk, such as when we gamble, buy lottery tickets, or engage in extreme sports.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Job Choice</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s01_p01">We have already discussed how your choice of career should be based on discounted present value, taking into account the fact that it can be costly to move from one job to another. Your choice of career also reflects how you feel about risk and uncertainty. There are numerous kinds of jobs that differ in many dimensions. When choosing a job, we pay particular attention to wages or salaries, vacation plans, health coverage, and other benefits. We also take into account the job’s riskiness.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s01_p02">The most severe risk is, of course, the risk of death. Every year in the United States several thousand workers suffer fatal work injuries. For most of the last decade, this number has been between about 5,000 and 6,000, or the equivalent of roughly 4 deaths for every 100,000 workers. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s04_s01_f01">Figure 5.11 "Work Fatalities in the United States"</a> shows data on work-related deaths in the United States for 2006–9.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_014">The data come from Occupational Safety and Health Administration, “Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries,” accessed February 24, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://stats.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0008.pdf">http://stats.bls.gov/iif/oshwc/cfoi/cfch0008.pdf</a>.

Care must be taken when comparing international data because they are not always exactly comparable.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s01_p04">The risk of death is not the only job risk. Jobs also differ in terms of their risk of injury. In some cases, these injuries can have a severe impact on a person’s quality of life; in other cases, they may prevent an individual from working in the future. Professional athletes and other performers face the risk of injuries that can end their careers. These individuals sometimes buy insurance to help mitigate some of these risks. In 2006, for example, pop star Mariah Carey purchased a $1 billion insurance policy on her legs after signing up for an advertising campaign (“Legs of a Goddess”) with the Gillette shaving company. Bruce Springsteen’s voice is insured for $5.6 million.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_017">See starpulse.com, “Mariah Carey Takes Out $1 Billion Insurance Policy For Her Legs,” accessed March 14, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/05/30/mariah_carey_takes_out_1_billion_insuran">http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/05/30/mariah_carey_takes_out_1_billion_insuran</a> for an account of Ms. Carey’s insurance policy; Paul Bannister, “World's Biggest Insurer Takes on All Risks,” accessed March 14, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/insurance/old-lloyds1.asp">http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/insurance/old-lloyds1.asp</a>, details a number of unusual insurance policies.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s01_p05">Riskier jobs generally pay more. A firm that exposes workers to more risk must compensate them for that risk. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">compensating wage differential</a><span class="glossdef">The amount in excess of the normal wage paid to compensate a worker for undesirable aspects of a job.</span></span> is any difference in pay received by identical workers doing different jobs. (By “identical” we mean workers with comparable education, skills, experience, and so on.) Jobs that are unpleasant or dangerous will typically pay higher wages to compensate workers for the negative aspects of their jobs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s01_p06">To the extent workers do not like to face risks, jobs that are viewed as riskier tend to pay more on average. For example, a recent study found that nurses who were more likely to be exposed to the AIDS virus (HIV) received higher wages than comparable nurses who were less likely to be exposed.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_018">Jeff DeSimone and Edward J.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Asset Portfolio Choice</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s02_p01">Young people’s portfolios of assets are usually very simple: a typical college student might have only a checking account and a savings account. As you grow older, though, you will typically acquire a broader portfolio. Even if you do not directly purchase assets such as stocks and bonds, you may own them indirectly when you sign up for a pension plan. Because the return on stocks (and other assets) is uncertain, owning these assets is another type of risk you <em class="emphasis">choose</em> to take.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s02_p02">Owning a stock is somewhat like buying a lottery ticket. You pay some money to buy a share of the stock of some company. In return, you may be paid some dividends; at some time in the future, you may sell the stock. But at the time you buy the stock, you don’t know the payments you will receive in the future and you don’t know the future price of the stock. So by purchasing a stock, you are gambling. Whether the gamble is favorable or not depends on the price of the stock, the chance it will pay dividends in the future, and the future price. Choosing how to allocate the assets in a portfolio is a type of gamble we all make.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s02_p03">We cannot completely avoid this kind of gamble. Perhaps you think that putting cash in your mattress would be a way to avoid this risk, but that is not the case. Ultimately you care about what that money can buy in terms of goods and services. The real value of the money held in your mattress depends on the future prices of goods and services, which are not known to you today. The benefit of holding cash depends on the unknown inflation rate.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Buying a Lottery Ticket</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s03_p01">Some people, at some times, are eager and willing to engage in risky activities. People engage in extreme sports, where the danger appears to be part of the attraction. People go to Las Vegas or to Monaco to gamble. In many countries, citizens can purchase a wide variety of lottery tickets sold by their governments. This is a form of gambling: you buy a ticket and if you have the lucky number, then you get a (sometimes large) prize. If you do not have the lucky number, your money is gone.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s03_p02">The existence of lotteries and other kinds of gambling seems like a puzzle. If people are risk-averse, then they are supposed to want to get rid of risk. The purchase of a lottery ticket is the exact opposite: you give up a sure thing (the price of the ticket) for an uncertain outcome. Unlike the purchase of insurance, which is a way to avoid risk, buying a lottery ticket is a demand for a gamble. Why do so many people buy lottery tickets? Why do governments sell them?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s03_p03">Do lottery tickets have an expected value that exceeds the cost of the ticket? If the difference is big enough, then even a risk-averse person might want to buy a ticket. Consider a very simply lottery. Suppose there is one fixed prize, and there is a probability that you win the prize. Then your expected gain is just the probability of winning times the prize:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">expected gain = probability of winning × value of prize.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s03_p04">Using this equation, you can determine whether the price for a lottery ticket is high or low. If the price of the ticket exceeds the expected gain from buying the ticket, then the ticket is not a good deal. But if the price is low relative to the expected gain, then you may want to accept the risk and buy the ticket.</p>
        <p class="para block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s03_p05">Let us look at an example. One US lottery is called Powerball. On February 18, 2006, the prize was worth $365 million to the winner. The chance of getting the jackpot was 1 in 988,172,368.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_019">This is based on five balls selected ranging from 1 to 55 and a powerball ranging 1 to 42.

Despite the huge prize, the price of a ticket far exceeded its expected value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s03_p07">Another perspective on the lottery is from the viewpoint of the government selling these tickets. Consider the Texas lottery.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_020">Texas Lottery home page, accessed March 14, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.txlottery.org/export/sites/default/index.html">http://www.txlottery.org/export/sites/default/index.html</a>.</span> The proceeds from the sale of tickets primarily support education. In 2005, about 60 percent of the income from the lottery went to payment for prizes and 28 percent went to a school fund. From the perspective of the Texas state government, selling lottery tickets is a way to fund programs. If the government is to make money on lottery tickets, then those buying the tickets must, on average, be losing money.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s04_s03_p08">In fact, as this discussion suggests, the expected value of a lottery ticket is less—often substantially less—than the cost of the ticket. Why, then, do people buy lottery tickets? One possibility is that they simply enjoy gambling. This means that, at least with respect to these types of gambles, they are <em class="emphasis">risk-loving</em> rather than risk-averse. The pleasure of a lottery ticket is, among other things, the license to dream. Another possibility is that individuals overestimate their chances of winning.</p>

        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch05_s05_p01">Many decisions involve a trade-off between now and the future. Whenever we invest our time or money, we are giving up something today to obtain something in the future. So by saving some of our income, we give up consumption now for consumption in the future. When we go to a university, we give up income and leisure time today to get more consumption (through higher income) in the future.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch05_s05_p02">Once you start thinking about trade-offs over time, it is difficult to avoid the reality that many of these decisions are made in the face of great uncertainty. When we save, we are not certain of the return on our saving. When we go to school, we are not guaranteed a job in the future nor are we guaranteed a specific salary. We have provided some insights into the nature of these uncertainties and how to deal with them. Discounted present value and expected value are techniques that are worthwhile to master, as they will help you make better decisions throughout your life.</p>

            <li>Explain why an increase in the interest rate reduces the discounted present value of income.</li>
            <li>What incentives exist for people to repay loans on education? On cars?</li>
            <li>Suppose the nominal interest rate is 20 percent, the price level in the first year is 50, and the price level in the second year is 60. What is the real interest rate? How could you alter this example so that the real interest rate is 0?</li>
            <li>Can the nominal interest rate ever be less than the real interest rate? If the real interest rate is negative, what happens to the slope of the budget line with two periods discussed in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch05#cooperecon-ch05">Chapter 5 "Life Decisions"</a>, <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch05_s01#cooperecon-ch05_s01">Section 5.1 "Consumption and Saving"</a>?</li>
            <li>Do households sometimes borrow and lend simultaneously? Why might that happen? Is the interest rate they borrow at usually higher or lower than the interest rate they receive, say in the form of bank deposits?</li>
            <li>In describing how changes in income influence the supply of loans, we assumed that the increase in income occurs this year. Suppose instead that the increase in income will occur next year even though everyone in the economy knew it would happen today. How would the news of a future increase in income influence the current loan supply curve?</li>
            <li>When the government changes taxes, do you know if it is permanent or temporary?</li>
            <li>(Advanced) One way that real wages received by workers can change is through a change in income taxes. Considering the information in this chapter, would you except temporary tax changes to have a bigger or a smaller impact on labor supply than a permanent tax change? What if the tax change is not through a change in the tax rate but rather through a fixed payment to households? What would that policy do to labor supply?</li>
            <li>Look back at <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch05_s02#cooperecon-ch05_s02_s01_t01">Table 5.2 "Which Career Should You Choose?"</a> in the section “Choosing a Career.” How would you edit the income entries in the table so that the insurance salesperson had a higher discounted present value than the lawyer even when the interest rate is 5 percent?</li>
            <li>Look back at <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch05_s02#cooperecon-ch05_s02_s01_t01">Table 5.2 "Which Career Should You Choose?"</a> in the section “Choosing a Career.” Explain why an increase in the interest rate makes it less attractive to be a lawyer.</li>
            <li>Besides discounted present values of income, what other factors are important in choosing a career? How do you balance these with differences in the discounted present value of income?</li>
            <li>What are the risks associated with choosing a particular career? How do those risks depend on whether the skills you learn at your job can be used in other jobs?</li>
            <li>Show the calculation of the discounted present value from work in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch05_s02#cooperecon-ch05_s02_s02_t01">Table 5.5 "Income from Going to College versus Taking a Job"</a>. Redo the comparison of college and work assuming an interest rate of 20 percent.</li>
            <li>(Advanced) Look back at <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch05_s02#cooperecon-ch05_s02_s01_t01">Table 5.2 "Which Career Should You Choose?"</a> in the section “Choosing a Career.” Suppose the income of a lawyer increases by 20 percent each year after year 2 and the income of the insurance salesperson increases by $10,000 each year. Extend <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch05_s02#cooperecon-ch05_s02_s01_t01">Table 5.2 "Which Career Should You Choose?"</a> to 5 years. Which is a better profession?</li>
            <li>Create your own version of <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch05_s03#cooperecon-ch05_s03_s01_t01">Table 5.8 "Coin-Flipping Experiment"</a> by flipping a coin 10 times. Imagine that each time the result is a head, you earn $1,000, and each time it is a tail, you lose $1,000. After you flip the coin 10 times, calculate how much you won (or lost). Now do this same experiment 20 times. Each time you flipped the coin 10 times, record how much you won (or lost), which will result in 20 numbers. What is the average of these 20 numbers? What is the expected value of how much money you will earn in each coin-flipping experiment??</li>
            <li>Many products, such as computers, come with the option of an <em class="emphasis">extended warranty</em>. Suppose you are buying a computer with a one-year warranty. Thereafter, you can purchase an extended warranty for one more year, at a cost of $50. The warranty will repair or replace your computer in the event of breakdown. Suppose the average cost to the manufacturer of repairing or replacing the computer is $1,000. If the manufacturer is making no money from this warranty, what is the implied probability that the computer will need repair?</li>
            <li>We wrote “As long as the insurance company has lots of policies in many locations, then, on average, the number of insurance claims will be nearly constant each year.” Why did we include the statement about many locations?</li>
            <li>Why is it difficult to diversify job risk? Is it possible to do some diversification within a family?</li>
            <li>In the United States, the provision of unemployment insurance is partly at the state level and partly at the federal level. For your state, find out what the benefits are and what federally funded unemployment insurance might be available to you.</li>
