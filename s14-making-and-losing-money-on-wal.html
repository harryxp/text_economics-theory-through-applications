        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s00_p01">In 2006 and 2007, the financial district in Shanghai, China, was in a frenzy. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s00_f01">Figure 10.1 "Shanghai Stock Exchange Index"</a> shows the value of stocks in that market since its inception in 2000. Starting in early 2006, the value of stocks traded on this market exploded. The market rose by 130 percent in 2006; by May 2007, it was up over 50 percent for that year.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn10_001">See <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=000001.SS&amp;=00&amp;=1&amp;=2006&amp;=11&amp;=31&amp;=2007&amp;=d&amp;=66&amp;=330">http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=000001.SS&amp;=00&amp;=1&amp;=2006&amp;=11&amp;=31&amp;=2007&amp;=d&amp;=66&amp;=330</a>.</span> The market peaked in late 2007 and is currently at about 50 percent of that value. A lot of money was made by those who invested in the Shanghai market. And unfortunately a lot of money was lost.</p>

            <p class="para">This figure shows the closing prices on the Shanghai stock exchange between January 2000 and April 2010. Stock prices rose rapidly from 2006, peaking in October 2007, but decreased substantially over the next year. In late 2009, stocks rebounded again.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s00_p02">These gains attracted many investors. Funds from abroad poured into Shanghai. The savings accounts of Chinese households were another source of investment funds. From a <em class="emphasis">People’s Daily</em> Internet article posted on May 13, 2007, we learn the following: “More than 70 billion yuan (9.1 billion U.S. dollars) was transferred from savings accounts in Shanghai to stock trading accounts in the first four months of this year, the Shanghai branch of the People’s Bank of China estimated on Saturday. In April alone, [savings deposits denominated in Chinese currency] with Chinese banking institutions decreased by 8.5 billion yuan (1.1 billion U.S. dollars).”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn10_002">“Chinese Pour Savings Deposits into Stock Market,” <em class="emphasis">People’s Daily</em>, May 13, 2007, accessed March 14, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200705/13/eng20070513_374113.html">http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200705/13/eng20070513_374113.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s00_p03">During May 2007, stories circulated about households spending many hours carefully evaluating individual stocks and market returns. At the same time, it appeared that many relatively uninformed individuals were simply betting on the market, gambling on a quick return.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s00_p04">We said that some investors made money in the Shanghai market. Does that mean there is a lot of money <em class="emphasis">to be made</em> by investing in that market? These phrases sound similar but mean very different things. It is one thing to look back at a market and say you could have made money investing in that market. It is quite another to forecast that you will be able to make a high return in a market in the future. Investors who were attracted to the market in late 2007 had a very different experience: they lost a lot of money. Those who came into market in late 2008 were again able to profit as the market value rose over the following year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s00_p05">In this chapter, we study the markets for different kinds of assets. Assets include stocks—such as are traded in Shanghai, on Wall Street, and in other financial centers around the globe—but, as we will see, there are many other kinds of assets as well. Information on assets is easy to obtain. If you open almost any newspaper, the business section contains an enormous amount of detailed information on stocks sold in a variety of markets. That same section will contain information on bonds, which are another type of frequently traded asset. Part of our interest in this chapter is defining these assets more precisely. The terms <em class="emphasis">stocks</em> and <em class="emphasis">bonds</em> are used commonly, but we want to understand exactly what these assets are and how they are traded.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s00_p06">As we wrote this chapter, we had no idea whether we, too, should be putting our personal savings in the Shanghai stock exchange or in some other market around the globe. In the middle of 2007, it looked as if the surge in the Shanghai market was over. Market participants were concerned that the time of high gains had ended. Yet by November 2007, market values had again started to escalate. And then, as we said, the market peaked in late 2007 and decreased rapidly for the next year. This is part of the story of asset markets. They are extremely volatile and unpredictable. When you see these high returns in Shanghai and other markets, you might wonder:</p>

            <h3 class="title">Road Map</h3>
            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch10_s00_s01_p01">This chapter begins with a walk down a fictionalized Wall Street, where we describe various kinds of assets. We focus mainly on financial markets, although we will look at other assets as well. Financial markets are familiar to many of us from the financial pages of newspapers or reports on the evening news. Such markets provide a link between borrowers and lenders (<a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s00_s01_f01" xrefstyle="select:label">Figure 10.2</a>). Many of us are borrowers from banks, perhaps because we have a student loan, a car loan, or a mortgage for a house. Much of what we borrow from banks comes from deposits placed in banks by other households. Firms also borrow in the financial markets. They issue stock and sell bonds in financial markets to finance their investment in new factories and machines.</p>
            <div class="figure large medium-height" id="cooperecon-ch10_s00_s01_f01">
                <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 10.2</span> </p>

                <p class="para">Financial markets link borrowers and lenders.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch10_s00_s01_p02">We then turn to a discussion of the <em class="emphasis">pricing</em> of assets. We begin by thinking about an unusual asset: a fruit tree. A fruit tree gives us a certain amount of fruit each year, and the value of the tree depends on the value of the fruit it produces. We explain how to calculate the <em class="emphasis">value</em> of a fruit tree that lives for several years and yields an uncertain crop, and we show how exactly the same principles apply to the valuation of stocks, bonds, houses, and other assets. Finally, we explain why—if financial markets are functioning well—the <em class="emphasis">price</em> of an asset will equal its value.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch10_s00_s01_p03">Finally, we ask whether it is easy to make money by trading assets. We explain that the gains and losses from trading assets are based on two factors: (1) luck and (2) the skill of investors who quickly recognize profit opportunities before others notice these opportunities. If financial markets are functioning well, then it is very difficult for the casual investor to make money consistently by trading financial assets. And even if—as many believe—financial markets do not function perfectly, this still does not mean that there is easy money to be made.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_p02">Wall Street in New York City is the financial capital of the United States. There are other key financial centers around the globe: Shanghai, London, Paris, Hong Kong, and many other cities. These financial centers are places where traders come together to buy and sell assets. Beyond these physical locations, opportunities for trading assets abound on the Internet as well.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_p03">We begin the chapter by describing and explaining some of the most commonly traded assets. Ownership of an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">asset</a><span class="glossdef">A resource whose ownership gives you the right to some future benefit or a stream of benefits.</span></span> gives you the right to some future benefit or a stream of benefits. Very often, these benefits come in the form of monetary payments; for example, ownership of a stock gives you the right to a share of a firm’s profits. Sometimes, these benefits come in the form of a flow of services: ownership of a house gives you the right to enjoy the benefits of living in it.</p>
    <div class="section" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Stocks</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_p01">One of the first doors you find on Wall Street is called the <em class="emphasis">stock exchange</em>. The stock exchange is a place where—as the name suggests—stocks are bought and sold. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stock (or share)</a><span class="glossdef">An asset that comes in the form of (partial) ownership of a firm.</span></span> is an asset that comes in the form of (partial) ownership of a firm. The owners of a firm’s stock are called the shareholders of that firm because the stock gives them the right to a share of the firm’s profits. More precisely, shareholders receive payments whenever the board of directors of the firm decides to pay out some of the firm’s profits in the form of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dividends</a><span class="glossdef">A payment from a firm to a firm’s shareholders based on the firm’s profits.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_p02">Some firms—for example, a small family firm like a corner grocery store—are privately owned. This means that the shares of the firm are not available for others to purchase. Other firms are publicly traded, which means that anyone is free to buy or sell their stocks. In many cases, particularly for large firms such as Microsoft Corporation or Nike, stocks are bought and sold on a minute-by-minute basis. You can find information on the prices of publicly traded stocks in newspapers or on the Internet.</p>
        <div class="section" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Stock Market Indices</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p01">Most often, however, we hear not about individual stock prices but about baskets of stocks. The most famous basket of stocks is called the <em class="emphasis">Dow Jones Industrial Average</em> (DJIA). Each night of the week, news reports on the radio and television and newspaper stories tell whether the value of the DJIA increased or decreased that day. The DJIA is more than a century old—it started in 1896—and is a bundle of 30 stocks representing some of the most significant firms in the US economy. Its value reflects the prices of these stocks. Very occasionally, one firm will be dropped from the index and replaced with another, reflecting changes in the economy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn10_003">You can learn more about the DJIA if you go to NYSE Euronext, “Dow Jones Industrial Average,” accessed March 14, 2011,<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nyse.com/marketinfo/indexes/dji.shtml">http://www.nyse.com/marketinfo/indexes/dji.shtml</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p02"><a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 10.3 "The DJIA: October 1928 to July 2007"</a> shows the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1928 to 2011. Over that period, the index rose from about 300 to about 12,500, which is an average growth rate of about 4.5 percent per year. You can see that this growth was not smooth, however. There was a big decrease at the very beginning, known as the stock market crash of 1929. There was another very significant drop in October 1987. Even though the 1929 crash looks smaller than the 1987 decrease, the 1929 crash was much more severe. In 1929, the stock market lost about half its value and took many years to recover. In 1987, the market lost only about 25 percent of its value and recovered quite quickly.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p03">One striking feature of <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 10.3 "The DJIA: October 1928 to July 2007"</a> is the very rapid growth in the DJIA in the 1990s and the subsequent decrease around the turn of the millennium. The 1990s saw the so-called Internet boom, when there was a lot of excitement about new companies taking advantage of new technologies. Some of these companies, such as Amazon, went on to be successful, but most others failed. As investors came to recognize that most of these new companies would not make money, the market fell in value. There was another rise in the market during the 2000s, followed by a substantial fall during the global financial crisis that began around 2008. Very recently, the market has recovered again.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p04">If these ups and downs in the DJIA were predictable, it would be easy to make money on Wall Street. Suppose you knew the DJIA would increase 10 percent next month. You would buy the stocks in the average now, hold them for a month, and sell them for an easy 10 percent profit. If you knew the DJIA would decrease next month, you could still make money. If you currently owned DJIA stocks, you could sell them and then buy them back after the price decreased. Even if you don’t own these stocks right now, there is still a way of selling first and buying later. You can sell (at today’s high price) a promise to deliver the stocks in a month’s time. Then you buy the stocks after the price has decreased. This is called a <em class="emphasis">forward sale</em>. If this sounds as if it is too easy a way to make money, that’s because it is. The ups and downs in the DJIA are not perfectly predictable, so there are no easy profit opportunities of the kind we just described. We have more to say about this later in the chapter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p05">Although the DJIA is the most closely watched stock market index, many others are also commonly reported. The <em class="emphasis">Standard and Poor’s 500</em> (S&amp;P 500) is another important index. As the name suggests, it includes 500 firms, so it is more representative than the DJIA. If you want to understand what is happening to stock prices in general, you are better off looking at the S&amp;P 500 than at the DJIA. The <em class="emphasis">Nasdaq</em> is another index, consisting of the stocks traded in an exchange that specializes in technology-based firms.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p06">We mentioned earlier that the DJIA has increased by almost 5 percent per year on average since 1928. On the face of it, this seems like a fairly respectable level of growth. Yet we must be careful. The DJIA and other indices are averages of stock prices, which are measured in dollar terms. To understand what has happened to the stock market in real terms, we need to adjust for inflation. Between 1928 and 2007, the price level rose by 2.7 percent per year on average. The average growth in the DJIA, adjusted for inflation, was thus 4.8 percent − 2.7 percent = 2.1 percent.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Price of a Stock</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p01">As a shareholder, there are two ways in which you can earn income from your stock. First, as we have explained, firms sometimes choose to pay out some of their income in the form of dividends. If you own some shares and the company declares it will pay a dividend, either you will receive a check in the mail or the company will automatically reinvest your dividend and give you extra shares. But there is no guarantee that a company will pay a dividend in any given year.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p02">The second way you can earn income is through <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital gains</a><span class="glossdef">Income from an increase in the price of an asset.</span></span>. Suppose you own a stock whose price has gone up. If that happens, you can—if you want—sell your stock and make a profit on the difference between the price you paid for the stock and the higher price you sold it for. Capital gains are the income you obtain from the increase in the price of an asset. (If the asset decreases in value, you instead incur a <em class="emphasis">capital loss</em>.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p03">To see how this works, suppose you buy, for $100, a single share of a company whose stock is trading on an exchange. In exchange for $100, you now have a piece of paper indicating that you own a share of a firm. After a year has gone by, imagine that the firm declares it will pay out dividends of $6.00 per share. Also, at the end of the year, suppose the price of the stock has increased to $105.00. You decide to sell at that price. So with your $100.00, you received $111.00 at the end of the year for an annual return of 11 percent:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><math xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xml:id="fwk-cooperecon-10_m001" display="block"><semantics><mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mi>$</mi><mn>106.00</mn><mo>+</mo><mi>$</mi><mn>5.00</mn> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>$</mi><mn>100.00</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mn>0.11</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>11</mn><mi>%</mi><mtext>.</mtext> </mrow>  </semantics></math></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p04">(We have used the term <em class="emphasis">return</em> a few times. We will give a more precise definition of this term later. At present, you just need to know that it is the amount you obtain, in percentage terms, from holding an asset for a year.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p05">Suppose that a firm makes some profits but chooses not to pay out a dividend. What does it do with those funds? They are called <em class="emphasis">retained earnings</em> and are normally used to finance business operations. For example, a firm may take some of its profits to build a new factory or buy new machines. If a firm is being managed well, then those expenditures should allow a firm to make higher profits in the future and thus be able to pay out more dividends at a later date. Presuming once again that the firm is well managed, retained earnings should translate into extra dividends that will be paid in the future.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p06">Furthermore, if people expect that a firm will pay higher dividends in the future, then they should be willing to pay more for shares in that firm today. This increase in demand for a firm’s shares will cause the share price to increase. So if a firm earns profits but does not pay a dividend, you should expect to get some capital gain instead. We come back to this idea later in the chapter and explain more carefully the connection between a firm’s dividend payments and the price of its stock.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Riskiness of Stocks</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s03_p01"><a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 10.3 "The DJIA: October 1928 to July 2007"</a> reminds us that stock prices decrease as well as increase. If you choose to buy a stock, it is always possible its price will fall, in which case you suffer a capital loss rather than obtain a capital gain. The riskiness of stocks comes from the fact that the underlying fortunes of a firm are uncertain. Some firms are successful and earn high profits, which means that they are able to pay out large dividends—either now or in the future. Other firms are unsuccessful through either bad luck or bad management, and do not pay dividends. Particularly unsuccessful firms go bankrupt; shares in such a firm become close to worthless. When you buy a share in a firm, you have the chance to make money, but you might lose money as well.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Bonds</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s02_p01">Wall Street is also home to many famous financial institutions, such as Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and many others. These firms act as the financial intermediaries that link borrowers and lenders. If desired, you could use one of these firms to help you buy and sell shares on the stock exchange. You can also go to one of these firms to buy and sell bonds. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bond</a><span class="glossdef">A promise to make cash payments to a bondholder at predetermined dates (such as every year) until the maturity date.</span></span> is a promise to make cash payments (the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">coupon</a><span class="glossdef">The cash payments paid to a bondholder.</span></span>) to a bondholder at predetermined dates (such as every year) until the maturity date. At the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">maturity date</a><span class="glossdef">The date of final payment of principal and interest on a bond.</span></span>, a final payment is made to a bondholder. Firms and governments that are raising funds issue bonds. A firm may wish to buy some new machinery or build a new plant, so it needs to borrow to finance this investment. Or a government might issue bonds to finance the construction of a road or a school.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s02_p02">The easiest way to think of a bond is that it is the asset associated with a loan. Here is a simple example. Suppose you loan a friend $100 for a year at a 6 percent interest rate. This means that the friend has agreed to pay you $106 a year from now. Another way to think of this agreement is that you have <em class="emphasis">bought</em>, for a price of $100, an asset that entitles you to $106 in a year’s time. More generally (as the definition makes clear), a bond may entitle you to an entire schedule of repayments.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Riskiness of Bonds</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p01">Bonds, like stocks, are risky.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>The coupon payments of a bond are almost always specified in dollar terms. This means that the real value of these payments depends on the <strong class="emphasis bold">inflation rate</strong> in an economy. Higher inflation means that the value of a bond has less worth in real terms.</li>
                <li>Bonds, like stocks, are also risky because of the possibility of bankruptcy. If a firm borrows money but then goes bankrupt, bondholders may end up not being repaid. The extent of this risk depends on who issues the bond. Government bonds usually carry a low risk of bankruptcy. It is unlikely that a government will default on its debt obligations, although it is not impossible: Iceland, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal, for example, have recently been at risk of default. In the case of bonds issued by firms, the riskiness obviously depends on the firm. An Internet start-up firm operated from your neighbor’s garage is more likely to default on its loans than a company like the Microsoft Corporation. There are companies that evaluate the riskiness of firms; the ratings provided by these companies have a tremendous impact on the cost that firms incur when they borrow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p02">Inflation does not have the same effect on stocks as it does on bonds. If prices increase, then the fixed nominal payments of a bond unambiguously become less valuable. But if prices increase, firms will typically set higher nominal prices for their products, earn higher nominal profits, and pay higher nominal dividends. So inflation does not, in and of itself, make stocks less valuable.</p>

Generally, the rate at which the US federal government can borrow is much lower than the rate at which corporations borrow. As the riskiness of corporations increases, so does the return they must offer to compensate investors for this risk.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Real Estate and Cars</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s03_p01">As you continue to walk down the street, you are somewhat surprised to see a real estate office and a car dealership on Wall Street. (But this is a fictionalized Wall Street, so why not?) Real estate is another kind of asset. Suppose, for example, that you purchase a home and then rent it out. The rental payments you receive are analogous to the dividends from a stock or the coupon payments on a bond: they are a flow of money you receive from ownership of the asset.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s03_p02">Real estate, like other assets, is risky. The rent you can obtain may increase or decrease, and the price of the home can also change over time. The fact that housing is a significant—and risky—financial asset became apparent in the global financial crisis that began in 2007. There were many aspects of that crisis, but an early trigger of the crisis was the fact that housing prices decreased in the United States and around the world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s03_p03">If you buy a home and live in it yourself, then you still receive a flow of services from your asset. You don’t receive money directly, but you receive money indirectly because you don’t have to pay rent to live elsewhere. You can think about measuring the value of the flow of services as rent you are paying to yourself.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s03_p04">Our fictional Wall Street also has a car dealership—not only because all the financial traders need somewhere convenient to buy their BMWs but also because cars, like houses, are an asset. They yield a flow of services, and their value is linked to that service flow.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s04_p01">Further down the street, you see a small store listing a large number of different three-letter symbols: BOB, JPY, CND, EUR, NZD, SEK, RUB, SOS, ADF, and many others. Stepping inside to inquire, you learn that that, in this store, they buy and sell foreign currencies. (These three-letter symbols are the currency codes established by the International Organization for Standardization (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm">http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm</a>). Most of the time, the first two letters refer to the country, and the third letter is the initial letter of the currency unit. Thus, in international dealings, the US dollar is referenced by the symbol <em class="emphasis">USD</em>.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s04_p02">Foreign currencies are another asset—a simple one to understand. The return on foreign currency depends on how the exchange rate changes over the course of a year. The (nominal) <strong class="emphasis bold">exchange rate</strong> is the price of one currency in terms of another. For example, if it costs US$2 to purchase €1, then the exchange rate for these two currencies is 2. An exchange rate can be looked at in two directions. If the dollar-price of a euro is 2, then the euro price of a dollar is 0.5: with €0.5, you can buy US$1.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s04_p03">Suppose that the exchange rate this year is US$2 to the euro, and suppose you have US$100. You buy €50 and wait a year. Now suppose that next year the exchange rate is US$2.15 to the euro. With your €50, you can purchase US$107.50 (because US$(50 × 2.15) = US$107.50). Your return on this asset is 7.5 percent. Holding euros was a good investment because the dollar became less valuable relative to the euro. Of course, the dollar might increase in value instead. Holding foreign currency is risky, just like holding all the other assets we have considered.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn10_004">The currency market is also discussed in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch08#cooperecon-ch08">Chapter 8 "Why Do Prices Change?"</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s04_p04">The <strong class="emphasis bold">foreign exchange market</strong> brings together suppliers and demanders of different currencies in the world. In these markets, one currency is bought using another. The law of demand holds: as the price of a foreign currency increases, the quantity demanded of that currency decreases. Likewise, as the price of a foreign currency increases, the quantity supplied of that currency increases. Exchange rates are determined just like other prices, by the interaction of supply and demand. At the equilibrium exchange rate, the quantity of the currency supplied equals the quantity demanded. Shifts in the supply or demand for a currency lead to changes in the exchange rate.</p>

In general, you are not restricted to buying assets in your home country. After all, there are companies and governments around the world who need to finance projects of various forms. Financial markets span the globe, so the bonds issued by these companies and governments can be purchased almost anywhere. You can buy shares in Australian firms, Japanese government bonds, or real estate in Italy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn10_005">Some countries have restrictions on asset purchases by noncitizens—for example, it is not always possible for foreigners to buy real estate. But such restrictions notwithstanding, the menu of assets from which you can choose is immense.</span> Indeed, television, newspapers, and the Internet report on the behavior of both US stock markets and those worldwide, such as the FTSE 100 on the London stock exchange, the Hang Seng index on the Hong Kong stock exchange, the Nikkei 225 index on the Tokyo stock exchange, and many others.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s04_s01_p02">You could buy foreign assets from one of the big financial firms that you visited earlier. It will be happy to buy foreign stocks or bonds on your behalf. Of course, if you choose to buy stocks or bonds associated with foreign companies or governments, you face all the risks associated with buying domestic stocks and bonds. The dividends are uncertain, there might be inflation in the foreign country, the price of the asset might change, and so on. In addition, you face exchange rate risk. If you purchase a bond issued in Mexico, you don’t know what exchange rate you will face in the future for converting pesos to your home currency.</p>

Stepping inside, you see a casino floor, such as you might find in Las Vegas, Monaco, or Macau near Hong Kong. You are confronted with a vast array of betting opportunities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s01_s05_p02">The first one you come across is a roulette wheel. The rules are simple enough. You place your chip on a number. After the wheel is spun, you win if—and only if—you guessed the number that is called. There is no skill—only luck. Nearby are the blackjack tables where a version of 21 is played. In contrast to roulette, blackjack requires some skill. As a gambler in blackjack, you have to make choices about taking cards or not. The objective is to get cards whose sum is as high as possible without going over 21. If you do go over 21, you lose. If the dealer goes over 21 and you don’t, you win. If neither of you goes over 21, then the winner is the one with the highest total. There is skill involved in deciding whether or not to take a card. There is also a lot of luck involved through the draw of the cards.</p>

Perhaps there are some similarities between risking money at a gambling table and investing in stocks, bonds, or other assets. As this chapter progresses, you will see that there are some similarities between trading in financial assets and gambling in a casino.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s01_p01">Imagine that you own a very simple asset: an orange tree. The orange tree pays a “dividend” in the form of fruit that you can sell. What is the value to you of owning such a tree? You can think of this value as representing the most you would be willing to pay for the orange tree—that is, your valuation of the tree. As we proceed, we will link this value to the price of the orange tree.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s01_p02">We begin by supposing your orange tree is <em class="emphasis">very</em> simple indeed. Next year, it will yield a crop of precisely one orange. That orange can be sold next year for $1. Then the tree will die. We suppose that you know all these things with certainty.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s01_p03">The value to you of the orange tree today depends on the value of having $1 next year. A dollar next year is not worth the same as a dollar this year. If you have a dollar this year, you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it. The technique of discounted present value tells us that you must divide next year’s dollar by the <strong class="emphasis bold">nominal interest factor</strong> to find its value today:</p>

The interest factor is 1 plus the interest rate, so whenever the interest rate is positive, the interest factor is greater than 1.

Similarly, if you put $1 in a bank paying zero interest today, you would have exactly $1 in the bank tomorrow. When the nominal interest rate is zero, $1 today and $1 next year are equally valuable. As another example, suppose the nominal interest rate is 10 percent. Using the formula, the discounted present value is <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="fwk-cooperecon-10_m003" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>$</mi><mn>1.00</mn> </mrow><mrow><mn>1.1</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow>  </semantics></math></span> = $0.909.

Now we make our tree more closely resemble real assets in the economy. Suppose first that the tree lives for several years, yielding its flow benefit of fruit for many years to come. Finding the value of the tree now seems much harder, but there are some tricks that help us determine the answer. Orange trees—like stocks, bonds, and other assets—can be bought and sold. So suppose that next year, you harvest the crop of one orange, sell it, and then also sell the tree. Using this strategy, the value of the tree is as follows:</p>

This is a good starting point but is not realistic if we want to use our story to understand the value of actual assets.

The probability of 0 oranges is 10 percent—that is, 1 in 10 times on average, the tree yields no fruit. The probability of 1 orange is 50 percent: half the time, on average, the tree yields 1 fruit. And the probability of 2 oranges is 40 percent. The expected crop is obtained by adding together the numbers in the final column: 1.3 oranges.</li>

Also, from the <strong class="emphasis bold">Fisher equation</strong>, we know that increases in the inflation rate translate into changes in the nominal interest rate. If inflation increases by 10 percentage points and the real rate of interest is unchanged, then the nominal rate increases by 10 percentage points. So the discounted present value of the bond decreases. Inflation risk might cause a bondholder to include a risk premium when valuing the bond.</p>

The other part of the value of the share comes from the fact that it can be sold next year. Again, that share price must be discounted to put it in today’s terms. If the share does not pay a dividend next year, then its value is even simpler: the value of the share this year equals its price next year discounted by the nominal interest factor.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Arbitrage</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s03_s01_p01">Assets are traded in markets around the world. Typically, there are a large number of (potential) buyers and sellers for any given asset: thousands of people might be willing to buy Microsoft Corporation stock or sell government bonds if they felt the price was right. Also, assets are homogeneous: one US government 10-year bond is the same as another. This means that asset markets are a good example of <strong class="emphasis bold">competitive markets</strong>, which means that we can look at asset markets using <strong class="emphasis bold">supply and demand</strong>.</p>

This is the act of buying and then reselling an asset to take advantage of profit opportunities. The idea of arbitrage is to “buy low” and “sell high.” Arbitrage is usually carried out across two markets to profit from any difference in prices. The strict definition of arbitrage refers to buying and selling where there is no risk, meaning that profits can be made with certainty. A weaker meaning of arbitrage allows risk to be associated with the process.</p>

This would make an economist salivate, not because of the prospect of good coffee but because it presents an opportunity for arbitrage. Facing an offer like this, you could immediately go and buy a pound of coffee beans for $10. Then you could turn around and sell the coffee at $12 per pound. You would have made $2 easy profit. Forget about drinking the coffee: just buy and sell, buy and sell, pound after pound—and become a billionaire. This is an example of arbitrage.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_p01">We can think about arbitrage using the supply-and-demand framework. There are two markets: in one the coffee shop sells coffee, while in the other the coffee shop buys coffee. The demand of potential buyers would be extremely large, and the supply of coffee (from people selling it back) would likewise be very large. With the prices for buying and selling coffee as stated in the sign, demand could never equal supply in these two markets. An arbitrage possibility like this is not consistent with market equilibrium.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_p02">Using similar logic, we can argue that <em class="emphasis">the price of an asset will equal its value</em>.

They would definitely want to buy if the price were lower. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_f01">Figure 10.5 "Asset Demand and Supply"</a> shows the supply of and demand for trees in this case.</p>

There is a given stock of trees available. For prices below the asset value, no one wants to sell the asset. At prices above the value, everyone wants to sell the asset. So the supply curve is horizontal at a price equal to the asset value, all the way up to the point where every tree is on the market. At that point, the supply curve becomes vertical. The demand function is in part (b) of <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_f01">Figure 10.5 "Asset Demand and Supply"</a>. At a price above the discounted present value of the tree, the quantity demanded is zero: no one will pay more than the discounted present value for the asset. If the price equals the value, the demand is flat (horizontal). At a price below the value, the asset looks like a great deal because there are arbitrage opportunities. So demand is very large.</p>

Both supply and demand are horizontal at a price equal to the discounted present value of the asset. Thus at this price, and at this price only, supply equals demand. We obtain a powerful prediction: <em class="emphasis">assets will be priced at their discounted present value</em>. If we see the prices of assets (such as stocks or bonds) increase or decrease, this model of the asset market tells us to attribute these variations to changes in the discounted present value of dividends.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_p06">The supply and demand curves in these figures look rather untraditional. We are used to seeing upward sloping supply curves and downward sloping demand curves. But in the market for the tree, everyone values the asset in exactly the same way. That valuation is given by the discounted present value of the dividend stream. As a result, <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_f02">Figure 10.6 "Asset Market Equilibrium"</a> does not tell us how much people will trade or if they will trade at all. When the price equals the discounted present value, buyers are indifferent about buying, and sellers are indifferent about selling. Everyone is happy to trade, but no one particularly wants to trade. In reality, though, the market for an asset may look much more like a “normal” supply-and-demand diagram, as in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_f03">Figure 10.7 "Asset Market Equilibrium: A More Familiar View"</a>, with an upward-sloping supply curve and downward-sloping demand curve. The reason is that different individuals may have differing views about the discounted present values of the asset, because<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn10_007"><a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch06#cooperecon-ch06">Chapter 6 "eBay and craigslist"</a> discusses in some detail the reasons why people trade.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_p07">For example, suppose some buyers are optimistic about future dividends from a stock, while others are pessimistic. Optimistic buyers will calculate a high discounted present value and have a high willingness to pay. Pessimistic buyers will calculate a lower discounted present value and be willing to pay less for the asset. Such differences in views can hold for sellers as well. Alternatively, suppose some buyers and sellers are more risk-averse than others. The less risk-averse the buyer, the higher the price he is willing to pay because he uses a lower risk premium when calculating his discounted present value. The less risk-averse the seller, the higher the price she is willing to accept.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_p08">There is one last, more subtle point. We have been imprecise—intentionally—about what exactly it means for an asset to be risky. Buyers and sellers care not only about assets in isolation but also about how those assets fit into their entire portfolio—that is, the entire collection of assets that they own. An asset that seems very risky to one person may appear less risky to another because he holds other assets that balance out the risks. The riskiness of an individual asset depends on the <strong class="emphasis bold">diversification</strong> of the portfolio as a whole.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_p09">In <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_f02">Figure 10.6 "Asset Market Equilibrium"</a>, all traders in the market valued the asset in exactly the same way, so arbitrage guaranteed that the price equals the discounted value of the flow benefit. In <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_f03">Figure 10.7 "Asset Market Equilibrium: A More Familiar View"</a>, there is no immediate guarantee that this will still be true. Even with differences in valuation, however, we expect that the price of an asset is still likely to be (at least approximately) equal to its true discounted present value. In particular, if some traders in the market do not care about risk and are accurately informed about the flow benefit, arbitrage will still keep the market price close to the discounted present value of the stock.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s03_s02_p10">We have not yet explained how supply and demand actually come together in financial markets—that is, who actually makes the market? If you study the workings of a market such as the New York Stock Exchange, you will learn that it works through specialized traders. If you want to buy a stock, you typically contact a stockbroker who communicates your demand to his firm on Wall Street. Another broker then takes that order onto the floor of the stock exchange and looks for a seller. If a seller is found, then a deal can be made. Otherwise, the broker can place your order with another specialist who essentially “makes the market” by buying and selling securities at posted prices. So in the end, the market has some elements of posted prices (take-it-or-leave-it offers) and some elements of a double-oral auction.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn10_008">Both of these are discussed in more detail in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch06#cooperecon-ch06">Chapter 6 "eBay and craigslist"</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s03_s03_p07">This is a more complicated formula.

In other words, the value of the tree today is the discounted present value of the flow benefits over the entire lifetime of the tree.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s03_s03_p08">There is one last step. If we again use the idea that the price of the tree should equal its value, then we can conclude the following:</p>

As discussed previously, the adjustment for risk will reflect both the riskiness of the stock and the aversion to risk of investors. Riskier stocks generally have a lower value and a higher expected return.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s01_s01_p02">Can you make money buying and selling this stock? It seems unlikely. If the price of a stock is equal to the present discounted value of the flow of dividends, then you get what you pay for. If you sell the stock, then instead of an asset that would have paid you the equivalent of $609.61, you receive $609.61 in cash. If you buy the stock, the reverse is true. Either way, you are no richer or poorer after the transaction; you are just holding your wealth in a different form.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s01_s01_p03">Economists often use the metaphor of $100 bills lying on the ground to describe a situation where easy money can be made. Our example of the arbitrage opportunity in the coffee shop, where you could buy beans at $10 a pound and resell them at $12 a pound, is an example: getting rich in that coffee shop is as easy as picking up money on the floor. But if the value of a stock is the discounted present value of the dividends that it will pay, then there is no easy money to be made. There are no $100 bills lying around. You should not anticipate spectacular earnings from owning assets. You can earn a reasonable rate of return, equal to the nominal interest rate, but no more. A market with the characteristic that you cannot expect to earn abnormal profits is called an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">efficient market</a><span class="glossdef">One in which the price of an asset equals the discounted present value of the flow of benefits.</span></span>. In such a market, the price of an asset accurately reflects the best forecast of the value of that asset. The value of an asset is the discounted present value of the flow benefits.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s01_s01_p04">Yet this may strike you as odd. There are many people who certainly make it rich by buying and selling stocks, bonds, and other assets. Some of these individuals—like Warren Buffett or George Soros—are household names. Does the fact that some people get very rich on Wall Street mean that markets are not efficient?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s01_s01_p05">There are a couple of possible answers to this question. The first is that even when markets are efficient, some people may get rich. Go back to the stock we were considering earlier but with one small change. Imagine that the numbers in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s04_s01_s01_t01">Table 10.3 "Discounted Present Value of Dividends in Dollars"</a> are now <em class="emphasis">expected</em> dividends. They tell you what this stock can be expected to pay out on average, but they are not guaranteed. For example, it might be the case that in year four, the firm will pay a dividend of $800 with 50 percent probability but will also pay $0 with 50 percent probability. The expected dividend is $400. If people care only about the expected value of the dividends (if they are risk-neutral), the price of the stock still equals the (expected) discounted present value.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s01_s01_p06">Now, there are still no $100 bills on the ground. You cannot expect to make unusual profits by buying this stock or others like it. However, some people will get lucky and thus get rich. If you bought this stock, and it ended up paying the high dividend, you would end up with a return nicely above the market interest rate. If it failed to pay the dividend, however, you would get a lower return than the market interest rate. As we looked around the economy, we would see some lucky investors earning high returns and other unlucky investors earning low returns. In this world, buying and selling assets in the stock market is really not that different from betting on a roulette wheel. Buying an asset is like placing your chip on a certain number. If the number comes up, you get rich. If it does not, you lose.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s01_s01_p07">When you go to a casino, you should not <em class="emphasis">expect</em> to win at roulette. But this does not mean that you can never earn spectacular amounts of money. It happens frequently: casinos thrive on advertising these success stories. The same goes for buying an asset, such as a stock. Suppose you buy a share in a pharmaceutical company. The price of the share when you purchase it might indeed equal the expected discounted present value of dividends. Yet the following week the company could have a major discovery that will allow it to be much more profitable in the future. Expected dividends will increase, and so will the stock price. This is certainly good news for you. But it is also no different from getting lucky on the roulette wheel.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s01_s01_p08">Spectacular successes tend to be more visible than losses. In the 1990s, some people earned large amounts (sometimes spectacularly large amounts) from certain successful Internet companies. But many other people lost money on Internet companies that were ultimately unsuccessful, and you are less likely to hear about them.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Is Wall Street Like a Blackjack Table?</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s01_s02_p01">More than luck is required when investing on Wall Street, however. Just as there are skilled players of blackjack in the casino, there are people who are skilled in assessing the prospects of different firms in an economy.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s01_s02_p02">If the price of a share equals the discounted present value of the dividends that a company will pay, then the total value of all the shares in a company should equal the discounted present value of the total profits the firm will pay out—both now and in the future. The total value of all the outstanding shares in a firm is called its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">market capitalization</a><span class="glossdef">The total value of all the outstanding shares in a firm.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s01_s02_p03">The price of a share increases whenever a firm’s market capitalization increases, and a firm’s market capitalization should increase whenever there is reason to think that the firm has become more profitable—either now or in the future. If markets are efficient, therefore, we expect share prices to respond to <em class="emphasis">new information</em> about a firm. Traders in large financial firms make their money in part by gathering new information about firms and then acting very quickly on that new information. News about a firm—good or bad—is likely to be incorporated quickly into a firm’s market price, but a trader who can move fast can make money from these movements.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s01_s02_p04">When economists use the metaphor of $100 bills lying on the ground, they are pointing out that if opportunities for easy profits arise, they will disappear very quickly. It is not impossible that someone will drop a $100 bill. But it is highly unlikely that that bill will lie unretrieved for more than a few minutes. If there is easy money to make in the market by buying a stock, professional traders will jump on the opportunity quickly. This has an important implication for the rest of us. If you read in the newspaper today that Merck Pharmaceuticals has just announced a new pharmaceutical compound that is highly effective in treating lung cancer, there is no point in calling your broker and instructing him to buy Merck stock on the basis of this news. Somebody—a very smart trader with her ear to the ground and lots of knowledge about the pharmaceutical industry—might well have made money buying Merck stock at the first hint of this news. But by the time there is an announcement in the paper, the increase in Merck’s expected profits has long been factored into the price.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Are Markets Efficient?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s02_p01">The theory of efficient financial markets is very powerful because it gives us a key to understanding the prices of assets. Go back to our equation for the value of an asset:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><math xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xml:id="fwk-cooperecon-10_m0024" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>value of asset this year = </mtext><mfrac><mrow><mtext>flow benefit from asset + price of asset next year</mtext> </mrow><mrow><mtext>nominal interest factor</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac><mtext>.</mtext> </mrow>  </semantics></math></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s02_p02">In the case of a share, the flow benefit is the value of the dividend. If the price next year is the discounted present value of further dividends from that point in time onward, then this equation is another way of saying that the value of the share today equals the discounted present value of dividends.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s02_p03">But what if the price that everyone expects an asset to sell for next year is—for some reason—much higher than the discounted present value of the flow benefit from the asset starting next year? As an example, consider a house. You buy a house in part to enjoy living in it—to enjoy “housing services.” You also buy a house as a possible source of capital gains if the price of the house increases. Imagine you live somewhere where everyone seems to think housing prices will increase a lot over the next few years. Then you should be willing to pay more for a house. After all, if you anticipate a large capital gain in five years from selling the house, you can pay more for it now and still expect a good return. So if everyone expects the price of houses to increase in the future, then the current demand for houses increases, so the current price increases. The price increase today reflects the expectation of higher prices in the future.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s02_p04">Now fast forward to next year. We can say the same thing applied to next year: “If everyone expects the price of houses to increase in the future, then the current demand for houses increases, so the current price increases.” This can go on from year to year: housing prices are high because everyone expects higher prices in the future. Higher prices have an element of self-fulfilling prophecy: prices increase because everyone thinks prices will continually increase.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s02_p05">This is sometimes called a housing <em class="emphasis">bubble</em>. In a bubble, the increase in the price of housing does <em class="emphasis">not</em> reflect an increase in the value people place in housing services. In the language of economics, the price is not changing because of any change in the <em class="emphasis">fundamentals</em>. Furthermore, it is possible that prices will not actually keep increasing. If everyone suddenly becomes more pessimistic about the future of housing prices, then the capital gains that everyone anticipated are gone, and housing prices collapse. In this case, the bubble bursts, and prices fall—sometimes very rapidly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s02_p06">Many economists think that something like this happened in the early stages of the global financial crisis that started in around 2007. The price of housing in many markets had been increasing substantially, and people expected this to continue. At some point, people stopped being so confident that house prices would keep increasing—and, sure enough, the price of houses then decreased rapidly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s02_p07">The same idea applies to stocks. If everyone believes the value of a particular stock will be higher in the future, then the price will be bid up today. If these beliefs persist, they can sustain a bubble in the stock. If everyone believes that stocks will generally increase in price, then this can lead to a bubble in the entire stock market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s02_p08">Data on the prices of stocks can perhaps help us see if the efficient market view is accurate, or if we instead see lots of bubbles. This sounds like an easy exercise but is actually very hard. It is difficult to calculate the discounted present value of expected dividends because it requires forecasts of the future. The usual interpretation of this evidence is that the efficient market hypothesis is not capable of explaining all the variations in asset prices, particularly over short periods of time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s02_p09">An extreme example illustrates this point well. Here is a quotation from an article that appeared in the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> after the collapse in the US stock market in 1987: “Calmly appraised, the intrinsic value of American industry didn’t fall 23 percent in a day.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn10_009">Roger Lowenstein, “After the Fall: Some Lessons Are Not So Obvious,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, August 25, 1997.</span> “The intrinsic value of American industry” refers to the total market capitalization of all the firms quoted on the stock exchange. It is hard to explain such short-run variations in asset prices from the perspective of discounted present value of dividends.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s02_p10">Economist Robert Shiller claims that stock markets can exhibit “irrational exuberance.” He argues that asset prices move around too much to be explained by theories that rely on the discounted present value of dividends to the price of assets. Instead, the fluctuation of prices, at least over short periods of time, might also be influenced by expectations and bubbles. More generally, Shiller is one of many financial economists who believe that economic theory needs to be supplemented with some ideas from social psychology to do a better job of explaining the performance of financial assets. Such <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">behavioral finance</a><span class="glossdef">The incorporation of some ideas from psychology into the theory of financial markets.</span></span> has identified several <em class="emphasis">anomalies</em>—that is, occasions on which asset prices apparently diverge from the values predicted by efficient market theory.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s02_p11">Despite the insights of behavioral finance, most economists take the view that, at the very least, efficient market theory is the best starting point for thinking about asset prices. Efficient market theory provides us with two key insights: (1) the price of a stock should reflect expectations about future profits, which means that (2) the price of a stock should change when—and only when—there is new information that changes those expectations. Many economists nonetheless think this approach is incomplete and that behavioral finance can also help us understand financial markets. A word of caution: even if markets are not always efficient, this still does not mean that there are easy ways to make money on Wall Street.</p>

Newscasters report on the volume of trade (the number of shares exchanged) and some index of the price of stocks, such as the DJIA.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s03_s01_p09">Pfizer’s announcement is the <strong class="emphasis bold">exogenous variable</strong> in this comparative statics exercise. The story tells us that the announcement led to a decrease in price and a large amount of trading. Let us try to make sense of this. First the announcement clearly contained new information that the markets had not anticipated. Indeed, the article tells us that, a few days previously, there had been positive information about this product.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s03_s01_p10">Because market participants did not previously know the results of the clinical trials, and because the announcement is bad news, analysts and market professionals immediately revise downward their estimates of the future profitability of Pfizer. They now expect that dividends in future years will be lower than they had previously thought. This reduction in the discounted present value of dividends causes the stock price to decrease.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s03_s01_p11">The way this works in the supply-and-demand framework is shown in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s04_s03_s01_f01">Figure 10.8 "Bad News about a Firm’s Product Reduces the Value of Its Stock."</a>. The bad news influences both the demand and supply curves. Prospective buyers of the stock are not willing to pay as much for it, given the bad news. So at a given stock price, the quantity demanded decreases. In <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch10_s04_s03_s01_f01">Figure 10.8 "Bad News about a Firm’s Product Reduces the Value of Its Stock."</a>, the demand curve shifts to the left. Owners of the stock are now less interested in holding their shares. So at a given price, the quantity supplied increases. This means that the supply curve shifts to the right.</p>

The effect of the announcement on the quantity traded is not clear. It depends on the steepness of the curves and the relative shifts in supply and demand. In this particular example, we know that there was an unusually large amount of trading, so the equilibrium quantity increased.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s03_s01_p13">Had the results of the clinical trials already been leaked to the market, there would have been no new information from the announcement.

As the interest rate decreases, the discounted present value of an asset increases. So at a given price, the demand for an asset increases. This is shown as an outward shift in demand. Also, at a given price, the supply of the asset decreases. As the interest rate decreases, more holders of the asset want to hold onto it, so the quantity supplied to the market is lower at each price. A rightward shift of the demand curve, combined with a leftward shift in the supply curve, tell us that the price of an asset increases when the interest rate decreases. The effect of the interest rate change on the quantity traded is ambiguous: it depends on the relative slopes of the curves and how much the curves shift.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Multiple Asset Markets</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s03_s03_p01">On the walk down Wall Street, we noticed that there were many markets, all trading simultaneously. Yet we have looked at the market for each particular asset in isolation. This is a fine tactic for understanding how to do comparative statics. But the real world is more complex: a single event can impact multiple markets.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s03_s03_p02">Take, for example, the bad news on the test results for Pfizer. We saw that this news forced the firm’s stock price to decrease. But Pfizer may have also borrowed in years past by issuing bonds. What will happen to them when the bad news hits the bond market? The price of a bond is the discounted present value of the interest payments on a bond over its lifetime, taking into account the possibility of bankruptcy. So the bad news from the pharmaceutical company ought to depress the price of its bonds. This happens largely because the chance of bankruptcy—while surely small—increases with the bad news.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s04_s03_s03_p03">We observed earlier that the global financial crisis had its origins, at least in part, in the real estate market. The effects quickly spread beyond the housing market. Many people had borrowed to buy houses, and these loans—known as mortgages—were financial assets held by banks. When housing prices decreased, the value of these mortgages decreased as well. Moreover, these mortgages were often combined in various ways to make new assets. When housing prices decreased, the price of these related assets decreased as well. And because financial institutions sometimes had difficulty working out the value of their assets, there was a risk that they would go bankrupt. This in turn meant that anyone who had lent to such an institution now had an asset that was less valuable. Thus a collapse in the price of one asset—houses—led to a decrease in the price of all sorts of other assets in the economy as well.</p>

                    <li>If markets are efficient, then, on average, there are no excessive profits to be made in asset markets. Some people will be lucky and do better than average, while others will be unlucky and do worse than average.</li>
                    <li>Efficient markets provide a benchmark for asset valuation, though asset prices may sometimes deviate from these values.</li>
                    <li>We use comparative statics to study the effects of changes in asset supply and demand on prices. Shifts in asset demand may come from new information about a new product or a new technique established by a firm. Monetary policy may also influence the demand for an asset.</li>
                    <li>Asset markets respond to events, like the surprise announcement of a new product. Asset markets do not respond to changes today that were announced in the past, such as a change in interest rates by a central bank that was announced (or forecasted) weeks earlier.</li>

        <h3 class="title">In Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch10_s05_p01">The performance of the stock market is one of the most closely watched of all economic statistics. This chapter provided some clues as to why people care so much about the value of stocks and other assets.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch10_s05_p02">One reason is that people save by purchasing stocks and other assets. Thus savers want to know what determines the value of assets in the economy. Having read this chapter, you should now understand that the value of any asset is closely linked to the flow of benefits that the asset provides. Indeed, if markets are efficient, then the value of any asset should equal the discounted present value of the flow of benefits.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch10_s05_p03">There are two other reasons why we pay so much attention to the stock market. (1) If the value of a stock reflects the discounted present value of expected dividends, then the market capitalization of a firm represents the best guess as to the value of that firm—which depends ultimately on the profits that it will generate in the future. In that case, a stock market index represents our best guess of the overall value of all firms. It truly is a measure of an economy as a whole. (2) The stock market plays a key role in allocating an economy’s saving to those firms that can make the most profitable use of those funds.</p>

            <li>List the factors you think would make stock prices increase and decrease in the Shanghai stock exchange.</li>
            <li>An October 2007 article in the <em class="emphasis">Economist</em> magazine discusses land prices and office rents. According to the article, rents have recently increased, and land prices have been increasing in the past few years as well. Why would land prices and rents move together?</li>
            <li>Following from Question 2, what do you think has happened to the price of office buildings as rental rates have increased?</li>
            <li>Suppose an orange tree yields a crop of one orange after the first year and then two oranges in the second year. As before, let the price of an orange be $1 in both years. What is the value to you of buying the tree today and then selling it next year, after you have harvested the first orange? (Hint: first find the value of the tree tomorrow and then use that as the price for selling the tree.)</li>
            <li>Suppose an orange tree lives for two years, with a crop of five oranges in the first year and three in the second year. The price is $2 in the first year and $5 in the second year. If the interest rate is 20 percent, what is the price of the orange tree?</li>
            <li>(Advanced) The table titled Discounted Present Value Exercise provides information about the crop from an orange tree as well as the interest rate for a tree that lives four years. Assume that the price of oranges is $1 in the first year and then increases at 10 percent per year. What is the discounted present value of this tree?</li>
            <li>Suppose prospective buyers of houses become very optimistic about the future prices of houses. Existing owners, on the other hand, become very pessimistic about the future value of houses. What happens to the price of houses today?</li>
            <li>Suppose housing markets are efficient. If you see rapidly increasing prices in a market, do you think that rental rates are increasing as well?</li>
            <li>Explain how contractionary monetary policy can reduce housing prices.</li>

                <p class="para">(Advanced) In the first row of <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch10_s02#cooperecon-ch10_s02_s03_t01">Table 10.2 "Discounted Present Value of Dividends in Dollars"</a>, we considered a stock that pays a dividend of $1 this year and that will have a price of $2 next year. Suppose the inflation rate from this year to next year is 5 percent. There are two ways that you can correct for this inflation.</p>

                    <p class="para">You can adjust next year’s price and put it in terms of today’s dollars, so next year’s price is a “real price.” Then you can discount using the real interest rate, which you can get from the Fisher equation.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch10_s05_p04">Show that you get the same answer for the discounted present value using the second method as using the first method. (Note: when the interest rate is 10 percent, you should get exactly the same answer; when the interest rate is 5 percent, there will be a very small difference because the Fisher equation is an approximation.)</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s06_p06">If interest rates are constant over time, then the interest factors are easy to determine.

What about discounting dividends two periods from now? To discount <em class="emphasis">D</em><sub class="subscript">2</sub> to period 1, we would divide by (1 + <em class="emphasis">r</em>). To discount that back again to the current period we would again divide by (1 + <em class="emphasis">r</em>).
