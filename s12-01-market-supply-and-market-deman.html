(In this chapter, we use the terms <em class="emphasis">individual</em> and <em class="emphasis">household</em> interchangeably.) We show how to build the market demand curve from these individual demand curves. Then we do the same thing for supply, showing how to build a market supply curve from the supply curves of individual firms. Finally, we put them together to obtain the market equilibrium.</p>

Taking the price of a chocolate bar as given, as well as its income and all other prices, the household decides how many chocolate bars to buy. Its choice is represented as a point on the household’s demand curve. For example, at $5, the household wishes to consume five chocolate bars each month. The remainder of the household income—which is its total income minus the $25 it spends on chocolate—is spent on other goods and services. If the price decreases to $3, the household buys eight bars every month. In other words, the quantity demanded by the household increases. Equally, if the price of a chocolate bar increases, the quantity demanded decreases. This is the law of demand in operation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch08_s01_s01_p02">One way to summarize this behavior is to say that the household compares its <strong class="emphasis bold">marginal valuation</strong> from one more chocolate bar to price.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch08_s01_s01_p04">In most markets, many households purchase the good or the service traded. We need to add together all the demand curves of the individual households to obtain the <strong class="emphasis bold">market demand curve</strong>. To see how this works, look at <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch08_s01_s01_t01">Table 8.1 "Individual and Market Demand"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch08_s01_s01_f02">Figure 8.2 "Market Demand"</a>. Suppose that there are two households. Part (a) of <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch08_s01_s01_f02">Figure 8.2 "Market Demand"</a> shows their individual demand curves. Household 1 has the demand curve from <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch08_s01_s01_f01">Figure 8.1 "The Demand Curve of an Individual Household"</a>. Household 2 demands fewer chocolate bars at every price. For example, at $5, household 2 buys 2 bars per month; at $3, it buys 3 bars per month. To get the market demand, we simply add together the demands of the two households at each price. For example, when the price is $5, the market demand is 7 chocolate bars (5 demanded by household 1 and 2 demanded by household 2). When the price is $3, the market demand is 11 chocolate bars (8 demanded by household 1 and 3 demanded by household 2). When we carry out the same calculation at every price, we get the market demand curve shown in part (b) of <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch08_s01_s01_f02">Figure 8.2 "Market Demand"</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch08_s01_s01_p06">Because the individual demand curves are downward sloping, the market demand curve is also downward sloping: the law of demand carries across to the market demand curve. As the price decreases, each household chooses to buy more of the product. Thus the quantity demanded increases as the price decreases. Although we used two households in this example, the same idea applies if there are 200 households or 20,000 households. In principle, we could add together the quantities demanded at each price and arrive at a market demand curve.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch08_s01_s01_p07">There is a second reason why demand curves slope down when we combine individual demand curves into a market demand curve. Think about the situation where each household has a <strong class="emphasis bold">unit demand curve</strong>: that is, each individual buys at most one unit of the product. As the price decreases, the number of individuals electing to buy increases, so the market demand curve slopes down.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn08_006">See <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch04#cooperecon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Everyday Decisions"</a> and <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch06#cooperecon-ch06">Chapter 6 "eBay and craigslist"</a> for discussions of unit demand.</span> In general, both mechanisms come into play.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch08_s01_s02_p03">We typically expect that marginal cost will increase as a firm produces more output. Marginal cost is the cost of producing one <em class="emphasis">extra</em> unit of output. The cost of producing an additional unit of output generally increases as firms produce a larger and larger quantity. In part, this is because firms start to hit constraints in their capacities to produce more product. For example, a factory might be able to produce more output only by running extra shifts at night, which require paying higher wages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch08_s01_s02_p04">If marginal cost is increasing, then we know the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch08_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>Given a price, there is only one level of output such that price equals marginal cost.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch08_s01_s02_p05">Indeed, the supply curve of an individual firm is the same as its marginal cost curve.</p>

The equilibrium occurs at $10 and a quantity of 50 units. The table is based on the following equations:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch08_s01_s03_p06">Equations such as these and diagrams such as <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch08_s01_s03_f01">Figure 8.5 "Market Equilibrium"</a> are useful to economists who want to understand how the market works. Keep in mind, though, that firms and households in the market do not need any of this information. This is one of the beauties of the market. An individual firm or household needs to know only the price that is prevailing in the market.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch08_s01_s04_p01">Economists typically believe that a perfectly competitive market is likely to reach equilibrium for several reasons.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch08_s01_s04_l01">
            <li>If the prevailing price is different from the equilibrium price, then there will be an imbalance between demand and supply, which gives buyers and sellers an incentive to behave differently. For example, if the prevailing price is less than the equilibrium price, demand will exceed supply. Disappointed buyers might start bidding the price up, or sellers might realize they could charge a higher price. The opposite is true if the prevailing price is too high: suppliers might be tempted to try decreasing prices, and buyers might look for better deals. These are informal stories because the supply and demand curves are based on the idea that firms and consumers take prices as given. Still, the idea that there will be pressure on prices away from equilibrium is a plausible one.</li>
            <li>There is strong support for market predictions in the evidence from experimental markets.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn08_010">In <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch06#cooperecon-ch06">Chapter 6 "eBay and craigslist"</a>, we explain that a double oral auction, in which buyers and sellers meet individually and bargain over prices, typically yields results very close to the market outcome in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch08_s01_s03_f01">Figure 8.5 "Market Equilibrium"</a>.</span>
</li>
            <li>The supply-and-demand framework generally provides reliable predictions about the movement of prices.</li>
