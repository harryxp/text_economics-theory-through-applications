(2) The price of the asset may increase, in which case you get a capital gain. You might guess that the price of an asset should be linked in some way to the payments you get from the asset, and you would be right. In this section, we explain how to determine the price of an asset. To do so, we use two tools: <strong class="emphasis bold">discounted present value</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">expected value</strong>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn10_006">These tools are discussed at length in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch05#cooperecon-ch05">Chapter 5 "Life Decisions"</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s01_p01">Imagine that you own a very simple asset: an orange tree. The orange tree pays a “dividend” in the form of fruit that you can sell. What is the value to you of owning such a tree? You can think of this value as representing the most you would be willing to pay for the orange tree—that is, your valuation of the tree. As we proceed, we will link this value to the price of the orange tree.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s01_p02">We begin by supposing your orange tree is <em class="emphasis">very</em> simple indeed. Next year, it will yield a crop of precisely one orange. That orange can be sold next year for $1. Then the tree will die. We suppose that you know all these things with certainty.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s01_p03">The value to you of the orange tree today depends on the value of having $1 next year. A dollar next year is not worth the same as a dollar this year. If you have a dollar this year, you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it. The technique of discounted present value tells us that you must divide next year’s dollar by the <strong class="emphasis bold">nominal interest factor</strong> to find its value today:</p>

The interest factor is 1 plus the interest rate, so whenever the interest rate is positive, the interest factor is greater than 1. We use the <em class="emphasis">nominal</em> interest factor because the flow benefit we are discounting has not been corrected for inflation. If this flow were already corrected for inflation, then we would instead discount by the <strong class="emphasis bold">real interest factor</strong>.</p>

Then using this formula, the discounted present value of a dollar next year is exactly $1. You would be willing to pay at most $1 today for the right to receive $1 next year. Similarly, if you put $1 in a bank paying zero interest today, you would have exactly $1 in the bank tomorrow. When the nominal interest rate is zero, $1 today and $1 next year are equally valuable. As another example, suppose the nominal interest rate is 10 percent. Using the formula, the discounted present value is <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="fwk-cooperecon-10_m003" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mrow><mi>$</mi><mn>1.00</mn> </mrow><mrow><mn>1.1</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow>  </semantics></math></span> = $0.909.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p01">Our orange tree was a very special tree in many ways. Now we make our tree more closely resemble real assets in the economy. Suppose first that the tree lives for several years, yielding its flow benefit of fruit for many years to come. Finding the value of the tree now seems much harder, but there are some tricks that help us determine the answer. Orange trees—like stocks, bonds, and other assets—can be bought and sold. So suppose that next year, you harvest the crop of one orange, sell it, and then also sell the tree. Using this strategy, the value of the tree is as follows:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p02">The first term is the same as before: it is the discounted present value to you of the crop next year ($1.00 in our example). The second term is the price that you can sell the tree for next year. After all, if the tree lives for 10 years, then next year it will still have 9 crops remaining and will still be a valuable asset.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p03">This expression tells us something very important. The value of an asset depends on</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p04">The insight that the value of the tree equals the value of the crop plus next year’s price greatly simplifies the analysis.

This is a good starting point but is not realistic if we want to use our story to understand the value of actual assets.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p02">Looking back at the tree that lives for one year only, imagine you do not know how many oranges it will yield.

The probability of 0 oranges is 10 percent—that is, 1 in 10 times on average, the tree yields no fruit. The probability of 1 orange is 50 percent: half the time, on average, the tree yields 1 fruit. And the probability of 2 oranges is 40 percent. The expected crop is obtained by adding together the numbers in the final column: 1.3 oranges.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s02_p05">We explained earlier that bonds are subject to inflation risk. There are two ways of seeing this in our example. Imagine that inflation increases by 10 percentage points.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s02_p06">This inflation means that the coupon payment next year will be worth less in real terms—that is, in terms of the amount of goods and services that it will buy. Also, from the <strong class="emphasis bold">Fisher equation</strong>, we know that increases in the inflation rate translate into changes in the nominal interest rate. If inflation increases by 10 percentage points and the real rate of interest is unchanged, then the nominal rate increases by 10 percentage points. So the discounted present value of the bond decreases. Inflation risk might cause a bondholder to include a risk premium when valuing the bond.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s03_p01">Now let us use our general equation to evaluate the dividend flow from stock ownership. Imagine you are holding a share of a stock this year. You can hold it for a year, receive the dividend payment if there is one, and then sell the stock. For now we treat both the dividend and the price next year as if they are known for sure. What is the value of a share under that plan?</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><math xml:id="fwk-cooperecon-10_m0014" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>value of share this year = </mtext><mfrac><mrow><mtext>dividend payment next year + price of share next year</mtext> </mrow><mrow><mtext>nominal interest factor</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac><mtext>.</mtext> </mrow>  </semantics></math></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s03_p02">This equation is similar to the one we used for the fruit tree and the bond. The flow benefit in this case is the dividend paid on the stock. Because the dividend is received next year, we have to discount it back to the current year using the nominal interest factor. The other part of the value of the share comes from the fact that it can be sold next year. Again, that share price must be discounted to put it in today’s terms. If the share does not pay a dividend next year, then its value is even simpler: the value of the share this year equals its price next year discounted by the nominal interest factor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch10_s02_s03_p03">The return to owning the share comes in two forms: the dividend and the gain from selling the share next year. To calculate the return per dollar invested, we divide the dividend and future price by the value of a share this year:</p>
