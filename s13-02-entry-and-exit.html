    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_p02">So far we have been thinking about a firm simply changing the number of labor hours that it wants to plug into its technology. Such job creation and destruction takes place at individual firms all the time. Some firms see an increase in productivity and hire more workers. Other firms see reduced demand for their output and destroy existing jobs. The joint creation and destruction of jobs underlies the net job creation we displayed earlier in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch09_s00#cooperecon-ch09_s00_f03">Figure 9.3 "US Net Job Creation from 2000 to 2009"</a>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_p03">Yet the expansion and contraction of employment in existing plants is only one source of job creation and destruction. During an economic downturn, such as the severe recession that began in 2008, some firms closed factories, and other firms went completely out of business. For example, US automobile manufacturers, such as General Motors, responded to the decreased demand for cars by closing some of their existing manufacturing plants. This led to job destruction at these plants. At other times, when an economy is expanding, new firms enter into business and existing ones open new plants. Thus a complete picture of the job creation and destruction process requires us to understand the economics of entry and exit.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_p04">Only when the firm’s managers know how much the firm is going to produce, the price at which it will sell it, and the cost of producing that output can they figure out profits and decide whether it is sensible to be in business at all. This logic applies to both managers of firms that are already in business and entrepreneurs who are considering starting a business. Firms also apply this logic to parts of their operations—for example, a firm may want to decide whether to shut down an existing plant or open a new one.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_p05">If a firm that is already in business discovers that its profits are too small to justify its other costs, then it should exit the market, shutting down its operations completely. If an entrepreneur is contemplating starting a new firm and calculates that the profits it will earn justify the costs of setting up operations, then we say that a firm enters the market.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_p06">In the previous section, we explained how job creation and destruction take place as firms expand and contract. When Walmart comes to town, however, much more is going on. The opening of a new Walmart means that some new jobs are created. Against that, existing stores may be forced to close down completely. Now that we have looked at a firm’s price and output decisions, we are able to analyze entry and exit decisions.</p>
    <div class="section" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Exit</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s01_p01">Businesses do not stay around forever. At some point, they exit the market, destroying jobs in the process. Restaurants that were a big hit only a few years ago can quickly lose their luster and disappear from the scene. The same is true for many retail outlets. Manufacturing plants also close, taking jobs with them. Imagine, for example, that you own a small clothes retailing store. Then Walmart comes to your town. Now your customers have another place to buy their clothes, and you must decide whether to stay in business. You need to decide which is more profitable: staying in business or closing your business down and selling off any assets you possess.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s01_p02">To understand the factors influencing firm exit, we begin with a key distinction between different kinds of costs.</p>

            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s01_p03">Costs that are the same at all levels of production are called fixed costs. Costs that vary with the level of production are called variable costs. As an accounting identity, the total costs of a firm are divided up as follows:</p>
            <span class="informalequation"><span class="mathphrase">total costs = fixed costs + variable costs.</span></span>

The numbers in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch09_s02_s01_t01">Table 9.3 "Monthly Costs of Production"</a> are based on the following equation for costs:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">total costs = 14,000 + 10 × quantity.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s01_p05">Suppose your firm has fixed costs every month of $14,000.

The answer to this question depends on when you ask.</p>

During the course of a month, you should stay in business because you are earning enough revenues to cover your variable costs. As soon as it is time to pay your monthly fixed cost again, though, you should choose to exit and close down your store. In this case, you would engage in job destruction by firing your sales clerk.</p>

Perhaps your customers will decide, after they have tried Walmart, that they prefer your store after all. It would then be foolish to close down your store immediately just because you fail to cover fixed costs in one month. This means you must make a decision in the presence of uncertainty: you don’t know for sure if your customers will come back, and if they do, you don’t know for sure that they will not go away again.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_p01">Our definition of fixed costs seems very straightforward. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to decide in practice whether a cost is fixed or variable. There are two main reasons for this:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Time horizon.</strong> Business planning must be carried out over multiple time horizons. You must decide what to do from one week to the next, from one month to the next, and from one quarter to the next. Costs that are fixed over short time horizons may be variable over longer time horizons. For example, suppose your contract with your employee says you must give her six weeks’ notice prior to letting her go. Then her wages are a fixed cost when you are planning for the next six weeks but a variable cost over a longer horizon. Similarly, you may have to lease your store space yearly, in which case that cost is fixed until your lease next comes up for renewal. The bottom line is that whether you think of a cost as fixed or variable depends on your time horizon.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">“Lumpiness.”</strong> Some inputs are easier to vary than others. You can freely decide how many pairs of jeans to buy from your wholesaler, so your purchase of jeans to sell is a variable cost. Other inputs are “lumpy”; they are fixed over some ranges of output but variable over others. This means that some costs are fixed over some ranges of output but variable over others. For example, you might be able to sell up to, say, 10,000 pairs of jeans a month in your current store space. However, if you wanted to expand beyond that, you would no longer have enough room to store your inventory and provide an acceptable shopping space for your customers. Because the size of your store is not something you can vary smoothly, this is a lumpy input.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s01_s02_p02">In fact, if we take a very long time horizon and very large ranges of output, there are few costs that are truly fixed.</p>

            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s02_p04">Entry costs are the one-time fixed costs that a firm incurs when establishing a business. The toolkit has more discussion of other kinds of costs.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s02_p05">Such costs of establishing a business can be very substantial. Notice, by the way, that entry costs are for the most part truly fixed costs. Walmart must incur these costs before it can let a single customer inside; these costs are fixed no matter how long the time horizon; these costs are largely independent of Walmart’s scale of operation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s02_p06">The senior management team must also predict how much profit they expect the store to make. These forecasts are based on the idea that, once the store is opened, the store will set its prices and manage its operations to maximize its profits. Because the team will be uncertain about profits, they will need to use expected value calculations. They will also be counting on a profit flow for years if not decades and will need to use discounted present value calculations. Thus the appropriate decision rule for a firm is to enter if<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn09_006">In <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch15#cooperecon-ch15">Chapter 15 "Busting Up Monopolies"</a>, you will find an example of very similar economic reasoning.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s02_s01_p01">Firms that enter markets know that it is possible that they will exit again in the future. Because their profit flow is uncertain, they recognize that there may come a point where they will judge it better to close down their operations. If they close down their operations, they may be able to sell off some of their existing assets. Therefore, when deciding to enter, managers also take into account the extent to which their assets are recoverable. If they are likely to be able to reclaim most of the value of their assets, then entry is more likely to be profitable even if demand turns out to be lower than expected.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s02_s01_p02">Specifically, we can divide entry costs into <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sunk costs</a><span class="glossdef">A cost that, once incurred, cannot be recovered.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">recoverable costs</a><span class="glossdef">A cost that, once incurred, can be recovered.</span></span>.</p>

                <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s02_s01_p03">A sunk cost is a cost that, once incurred, cannot be recovered. A recoverable cost is a cost that, once incurred, can be recovered.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s02_s01_p04">Looking back at our list of Walmart’s entry costs, we can see that many of these costs are sunk costs. All the planning and legal fees are completely tied to this store; if they end up not building the store, they cannot get any of the monies back. The building is a sunk cost as well. Other costs are at least partly recoverable. If they decide not to build the store, they can resell the land. If they have equipped the building with shelving and cash registers and then decide not to open the store, they can resell these assets or move them to another Walmart store instead.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s02_s01_p05">Economic reasoning gives clear instructions about sunk costs: they should be irrelevant for any future decision. Whether it was a good or bad idea to build a store, any decisions made going forward should take into account only the future profitability of the store. For example, suppose that Walmart’s entry costs were $100 million, of which $30 million were recoverable. Suppose also that Walmart’s managers estimated the discounted present value of expected profits at $120 million and therefore decided to build the store. However, once it was built, they discover that they have badly overestimated demand. The managers revise their estimate of future profits by half to $60 million. They now regret having built the store; it was a bad investment. <em class="emphasis">But they should still keep the store open because it is earning more than they could obtain by closing the store and selling its assets.</em></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch09_s02_s02_s01_p06">Even though the economic principle is clear, people frequently include sunk costs in their calculations instead of ignoring them. This is such a pervasive problem that it is given the name the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sunk cost fallacy</a><span class="glossdef">The mistake of including sunk costs in future-looking decisions, even though they should properly be ignored.</span></span>.</p>
