        <h2 class="title editable block">The Price of a Pill</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s00_p01">If you walk down the aisles of a supermarket, you will see thousands of different goods for sale. Each one will have a price displayed, telling you how much money you must give up if you want the good in question. On the Internet, you can find out how much it would cost you to stay in a hotel in Lima, Peru, or how much you would have to pay to rent a four-wheel drive vehicle in Nairobi, Kenya. On your television every evening, you can see the price that you would have to pay to buy a share of Microsoft Corporation or other companies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s00_p02">Prices don’t appear by magic. Every price posted in the supermarket or on the Internet is the result of a decision made by one or more individuals. In the future, you may find yourself trying to make exactly such a decision. Many students of economics have jobs in the marketing departments of firms or work for consulting companies that provide advice on what prices firms should charge. To learn about how managers make such decisions, we look at a real-life pricing decision.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s00_p03">In 2003, a major pharmaceutical company was evaluating the performance of one of its most important drugs—a medication for treating high blood pressure—in a Southeast Asian country. (For reasons of confidentiality, we do not reveal the name of the company or the country; other than simplifying the numbers slightly, the story is true.) Its product was known as one of the best in the market and was being sold for $0.50 per pill. The company had good market share and income in the country. There was one major competing drug in the market that was selling at a higher price and a few less important drugs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s00_p04">In pharmaceutical companies, one individual often leads the team for each major drug that the company sells. In this company, the head of the product team—we will call her Ellie—was happy with the performance of the drug. Nonetheless, she wondered whether her company could make higher profits by setting a higher or lower price. In many countries, the prices of pharmaceutical products are heavily regulated. In this particular country, however, pharmaceutical companies were largely free to set whatever price they chose. Together with her team, therefore, Ellie decided to review the pricing strategy for her product. In this chapter, we therefore tackle the following question:</p>

            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch07_s00_s01_p01">Price-setting in retail markets typically takes the form of a take-it-or-leave-it offer. The seller posts a price, and prospective customers either buy or don’t buy at that price. The prices you encounter every day in a supermarket, a coffee shop, or a fast-food restaurant, for example, are all take-it-or-leave-it offers that the retailer makes to you and other customers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn07_001"><a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch06#cooperecon-ch06">Chapter 6 "eBay and craigslist"</a> has more discussion.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch07_s00_s01_p02">In this chapter, we put you in the place of a marketing manager who has been given the job of determining the price that a firm should charge for its product. We first discuss the goals of this manager: what is she trying to achieve? We then show what information she needs to make a good decision. Finally, we derive some principles that allow her to set the right price. The chapter is built around two ideas:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn07_002">This chapter and <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch06#cooperecon-ch06">Chapter 6 "eBay and craigslist"</a> are linked because they are both about mechanisms that allocate goods and services. In <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch06#cooperecon-ch06">Chapter 6 "eBay and craigslist"</a> we explain how eBay, craigslist, and newspapers are ways in which individuals exchange goods and services. In this chapter, we study how goods and services are allocated from firms to households. At the end of this chapter, we show that the supply-and-demand framework introduced in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch06#cooperecon-ch06">Chapter 6 "eBay and craigslist"</a> is also a useful framework <em class="emphasis">when the same product is produced by a large number of firms</em>. In particular, we show that our ideas about pricing also allow us to understand the foundations of supply.</span></p>

            <li>What is the goal of a firm?</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s01_p02">Firms devote substantial resources to their decisions about pricing. Large firms often have individuals or even entire departments whose main job is to make pricing decisions. Consulting firms specialize in providing advice to firms about the prices that they should charge. Some companies, such as airlines, have dedicated software to help them make these decisions. It isn’t hard to understand why firms pay so much attention to the prices they charge. More than anything else, price determines the profits that a firm earns.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s01_p03">Economists are prone to talk about the decisions and objectives of a firm, and we often use the same shorthand. A firm, though, is just a legal creation—a collection of individuals who use some kind of technology. A firm takes labor, raw materials, and other inputs and turns them into products that people want to buy. Some of the people in a firm—the managers—decide how many workers it should hire, what prices it should set, and so on.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s01_p04">To understand pricing, we begin with the goal of a firm (that is, its managers). If a firm’s managers are doing their jobs well, they should be making decisions to serve the interests of the owners of that firm. The owners of a firm are its shareholders. If you buy a share in a firm, then you own a fraction (your <em class="emphasis">share</em>) of the firm, which gives you the right to a fraction of the firm’s earnings. Shareholders, for the most part, have one reason for buying and owning shares: to earn income. So the managers, if they are doing their jobs well, want a firm to make as much money as possible. We need to be careful, though. What matters is not the total amount of money received by a firm, but how much is available to be distributed to its owners. The owners of a firm hope to earn as high a return as possible on their shares.</p>

        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch07_s01_p05">The money that is available for distribution to the shareholders of a firm is called a firm’s profits. A firm pays money for raw materials, energy, and other supplies, and it pays wages to its workers. These expenses are a firm’s costs of production. When it sells the product(s) it has produced, a firm earns revenues. Accountants analyze these revenues and costs in more detail, but in the end all the monies that flow in and out of a firm can be classified as either revenues or costs. Thus</p>
        <span class="informalequation"><span class="mathphrase">profits = revenues − costs.</span></span>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s01_p06">Consider, then, a marketing manager who wants to set the best price for a product—such as Ellie choosing the price for her company’s blood pressure medication. She wants to find the price that will yield the most profits to her company. In an ideal world, a marketing manager might have access to a spreadsheet table, such as <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "A Spreadsheet That Would Make Pricing Decisions Easy"</a>, which displays a firm’s monthly profits for different possible prices that it might set. Then Ellie’s job would be easy: she would just have to look at the table, find the cell in column B with the highest number, and set the corresponding price. In this case, she would set a price of $15.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s01_p07">But the reality of business is different. It is very difficult and expensive—perhaps even impossible—to gather information such as that in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "A Spreadsheet That Would Make Pricing Decisions Easy"</a>. You might imagine that a firm could experiment, trying different prices and seeing what <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">profits</a><span class="glossdef">Revenues minus costs.</span></span> it earned. Unfortunately, this would be very costly because most of the time a firm would earn much lower profits than it could. Experimenting might even generate losses. For example, suppose that, one September, Ellie chose to try a price of $2 per pill. The firm would lose nearly $6 million—the equivalent of about six months’ profits even at the very best price. Ellie would rapidly find herself looking for another job.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s01_p08">It is clear that trial and error—choosing different prices at random and seeing how much profit you get—could lead to costly mistakes, and there is no guarantee that you would ever find the best price. By adding some structure to a trial-and-error process, though, there is a simple strategy for finding the best price: begin by slightly raising the firm’s price. If profits increase, then you are on the right track. Keep raising the price, little by little, until profits stop increasing. On the other hand, if profits decrease when you raise the price, then you should try lowering the price instead. If profits increase, then keep lowering the price little by little.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s01_p09"><a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s01_f02">Figure 7.2 "A Change in Price Leads to a Change in Profits"</a> shows how a change in price translates into a change in profits. A change in a firm’s price leads to a change in the quantity demanded. As a result, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">revenues</a><span class="glossdef">What a firm receives for selling its output, which is equal to the price received per unit sold times the number of units sold.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">costs</a><span class="glossdef">The payments a firm makes for its inputs, such as wages for its workers.</span></span> of a firm change, as do its profits. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s01_f03">Figure 7.3 "The Profits of a Firm"</a> shows the profits a firm will earn at different prices. Our pricing strategy simply says the following. You are trying to get to the highest point of the profit hill in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s01_f03">Figure 7.3 "The Profits of a Firm"</a>, and you will get there eventually if you always walk uphill. At the very top of the hill, the change in profits is zero.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_p02">A firm’s revenues are the money that it earns from selling its product. Revenues equal the number of units that a firm sells times the price at which it sells each unit:</p>
    <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">revenues = price × quantity.</span></span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_p03">For example, think about a music store selling CDs. Suppose that the firm sells 25,000 CDs in a month at $15 each. Then its total monthly revenues are as follows:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_p04">There are two ways in which firms can obtain higher revenues: sell more products or sell at a higher price. So if a firm wants to make a lot of revenue, it should sell a lot of its product at a high price. Then again, you probably do not need to study economics to figure that out. The problem for a manager is that her ability to sell a product is limited by what the market will bear. Typically, we expect that if she sets a higher price, she will not be able to sell as much of the product:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s01_p01">There will typically be more than one firm that serves a market. This means that the overall demand for a product is divided among the different firms in the market. We have said nothing yet about the kind of “market structure” in which a firm is operating—for example, does it have a lot of competitors or only a few competitors? Without delving into details, we cannot know exactly how the market demand curve will be divided among the firms in the market. Fortunately, we can put this problem aside—at least for this chapter.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn07_003">We look at market structure in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch15#cooperecon-ch15">Chapter 15 "Busting Up Monopolies"</a>.</span> For the moment, it is enough just to know that each firm faces a demand curve for its own product.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s01_p02">When the price of a product increases, individual customers are less likely to think it is good value and are more likely to spend their income on other things instead.

            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s01_p03">The demand curve facing a firm tells us the price that a firm can expect to receive for any given amount of output that it brings to market or the amount it can expect to sell for any price that it chooses to set.

For example, with this demand curve, if a manager sets the price at $10, the firm will sell 50 units because 100 − (5 × 10) = 50. If a manager sets the price at $16, the firm will sell only 20 units: 100 − (5 × 16) = 20. For every $1 increase in the price, output decreases by 5 units. (We have chosen a demand curve with numbers that are easy to work with. If you think that this makes the numbers unrealistically small, think of the quantity as being measured in, say, thousands of units, so a quantity of 3 in this equation means that the firm is selling 3,000 units.

In some cases, some firms produce a good that consumers want very much—a good in which few substitutes are available. For example, De Beers controls much of the world’s market for diamonds, and other firms are not easily able to provide substitutes. Thus the demand for De Beers’ diamonds tends to be insensitive to price. We say that De Beers has a lot of market power. By contrast, a fast-food restaurant in a mall food court possesses very little market power: if the fast-food Chinese restaurant were to try to charge significantly higher prices, most of its potential customers would choose to go to the other Chinese restaurant down the aisle or even to eat sushi, pizza, or burritos instead.</p>

There were a relatively small number of drugs available in the country to treat high blood pressure, and not all drugs were identical in terms of their efficacy and side effects. Some doctors were loyal to her product and would almost always prescribe it. Some doctors were not very well informed about the price because doctors don’t pay for the medication.

In particular, she needs to know whether the quantity demanded by buyers is very sensitive to the price that she sets.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p02">At an informal level, people working in marketing and sales are likely to have some idea of whether their customers are very price sensitive. Marketing and sales personnel—if they are any good at their jobs—spend time talking to actual and potential customers and should have some idea of how much these customers care about prices. Similarly, these employees should have a good sense of the overall market and the other factors that might affect customers’ choices. For example, they will usually know whether there are other firms in the market offering similar products, and, if so, what prices these firms are charging. Such knowledge is much better than nothing, but it does not provide very concrete evidence on the demand curve or the elasticity of demand.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p03">A firm may be able to make use of existing sales data to develop a more concrete measure of the elasticity of demand. For example, a firm might have past sales data that show how much they managed to sell at different prices, or a firm might have sales data from different cities where different prices were charged. Suppose a pricing manager discovers data for prices and quantities like those in part (a) of <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_f01">Figure 7.8 "Finding the Demand Curve"</a>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p04">The straight-line demand curves that appear in this and other books are a convenient fiction of economists and textbook writers, but no one has actually seen one in captivity. In the real world of business, demand curves—if they are available at all—are only a best guess from a collection of data. Economists and statisticians have developed statistical techniques for these guesses. The underlying idea of these techniques is that they <em class="emphasis">fit a line</em> to the data. (The exact details do not concern us here; you can learn about them in more advanced courses in economics and statistics.) Part (b) of <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_f01">Figure 7.8 "Finding the Demand Curve"</a> shows an example. It represents our best prediction, based on available data, of how much people will buy at different prices.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p05">If a firm does not have access to reliable existing data, a third option is for it to generate its own data. For example, suppose a retailer wanted to know how sensitive customer demand for milk is to changes in the price of milk. It could try setting a different price every week and observe its sales. It could then plot them in a diagram like <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_f01">Figure 7.8 "Finding the Demand Curve"</a> and use techniques like those we just discussed to fit a line. In effect, the store could conduct its own experiment to find out what its demand curve looks like. For a firm that sells over the Internet, this kind of experiment is particularly attractive because it can randomly offer different prices to people coming to its website.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p06">Finally, firms can conduct market research either on their own or by hiring a professional market research firm. Market researchers use questionnaires and surveys to try to discover the likely purchasing behavior of consumers. The simplest questionnaire might ask, “How much would you be willing to pay for product x?” Market researchers have found such questions are not very useful because consumers do not answer them very honestly. As a result, research firms use more subtle questions and other more complicated techniques to uncover consumers’ willingness to pay for goods and services.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p07">Ellie decided that she should conduct market research to help with the pricing decision. She hired a market research firm to ask doctors about how they currently prescribed different high blood pressure medications. Specifically, the doctors were asked what percentage of their prescriptions went to each of the drugs on the market. Then they were asked the effect of different prices on those percentages. Based on this research, the market research firm found that a good description of the demand curve was as follows:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">quantity demanded = 252 − 300 × price.</span></span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_p01">The next step is to understand how to use the demand curve when setting prices. The elasticity of demand describes how quantity demanded depends on price, but what a manager really wants to know is how <em class="emphasis">revenues</em> are affected by price. Revenues equal price times quantity, so we know immediately that a firm earns $0 if the price is $0. (It doesn’t matter how much you give away, you still get no money.) We also know that, at the choke price, the quantity demanded is 0 units, so its revenues are likewise $0. (If you sell 0 units, it doesn’t matter how high a price you sell them for.) At prices between $0 and the choke price, however, the firm sells a positive amount at a positive price, thus earning positive revenues. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_f01">Figure 7.9 "Revenues"</a> is a graphical representation of the revenues of a firm. Revenues equal price times quantity, which is the area of the rectangle under the demand curve. For example, at $14 and 30 units, revenues are $420.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_s01_p01">Earlier we suggested that a good strategy for pricing is to experiment with small changes in price. So how do small changes in price affect the revenue of a firm? Suppose, for example, that a firm has set the price at $15 and sells 25 units, but the manager contemplates decreasing the price to $14.80. We can see the effect that this has on the firm’s revenues in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_s01_f01">Figure 7.10 "Revenues Gained and Lost"</a>.</p>

This is shown in the figure as the rectangle labeled “revenues lost.” But the firm will sell more units: from the demand curve, we know that when the firm decreases its price by $0.20, it sells another unit. That means that the firm gains $14.80, as shown in the shaded area labeled “revenues gained.” The overall change in the firm’s revenues is equal to $14.80 − $5.00 = $9.80. Decreasing the price from $15.00 to $14.80 will increase its revenues by $9.80.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_s02_p09">We can thus divide the demand curve into two parts, as in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_s02_f02">Figure 7.13 "Marginal Revenue and the Elasticity of Demand"</a>. At low quantities and high prices, a firm can increase its revenues by moving down the demand curve—to lower prices and higher output. Marginal revenue is positive. In this region, −(elasticity of demand) is a relatively large number (specifically, it is between 1 and infinity) and we say that the demand curve is relatively elastic. Conversely, at high quantities and low prices, a decrease in price will decrease a firm’s revenues. Marginal revenue is negative. In this region, −(elasticity of demand) is between 0 and 1, and we say that the demand curve is inelastic. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_t02" xrefstyle="select:label">Table 7.3</a> represents this schematically.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s04_p01">The market research company advising Ellie made a presentation to her team. The company told them that if they increased their price, they could expect to see a decrease in revenue. At their current price, in other words, marginal revenue was positive. If Ellie’s team wanted to maximize revenue, they would need to recommend a reduction in price: down to the point where marginal revenue is $0—equivalently, where −(elasticity of demand) = 1.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s04_p02">Some members of Ellie’s team therefore argued that they should try to decrease the price of the product so that they could increase their market share and earn more revenues from the sale of the drug. Ellie reminded them, though, that their goal wasn’t to have as much revenue as possible. It was to have as large a <em class="emphasis">profit</em> as possible. Before they could decide what to do about price, they needed to learn more about the costs of producing the drug.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s03_p02">The goods and services that firms put up for sale don’t appear from nowhere. Firms produce these goods and incur costs as a result. When a marketing manager is thinking about the price that she sets, she must take into account that different prices lead to different levels of production and hence to different costs for the firm.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s03_p03">Your typical image of a firm probably involves a manufacturing process. This could be very simple indeed. For example, there are firms in Malaysia that produce palm oil. A firm in this context is little more than a big piece of machinery in the middle of a jungle of palm trees. The production process is hot, noisy, and very straightforward: (1) laborers harvest palm nuts from the trees surrounding the factory; (2) these palm nuts are crushed, heated, and pressed to extract the oil; and (3) the oil is placed into barrels and then sold. If you wanted to run a palm oil production business in Malaysia, you would need to purchase the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s03_l02">
        <li>Machine for extracting the oil</li>
        <li>Truck to transport the oil to market</li>
        <li>Generator to power the machinery</li>
        <li>Fuel to power the generator</li>
        <li>Gasoline for the truck</li>
        <li>Labor time from workers—to harvest the nuts, run the machinery, and transport the oil to market</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s03_p04">That’s it. It is not difficult to become a palm oil entrepreneur! In this case, it is quite easy to list the main costs of production for the firm.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s03_p05">In other businesses, however, it is much more difficult. Imagine trying to make a similar list for Apple Computer, with all its different products, production plants in different countries, canteens for their workers, pension plans, and so on. Of course, Apple’s accountants still need to develop a list of Apple’s expenses, but they keep their jobs manageable by grouping Apple’s expenditures into various categories. If this were an accounting textbook, we would discuss these categories in detail. Our task here is simpler: we only need to determine how these costs matter for pricing decisions.</p>

It calculates marginal cost in the last column. We have presented this table with marginal cost on separate rows to emphasize that marginal cost is the cost of going from one level of output to the next. In our example, marginal cost—the cost of producing one more unit—is $10. If you want to produce one unit, it will cost you $60. If you want to produce two units, your must pay an <em class="emphasis">additional</em> $10 in costs, for a total of $70. If you want to produce three units, you must pay the $70 to produce the first two units, plus the additional marginal cost of $10, for a total cost of $80, and so on. Graphically, marginal cost is the <em class="emphasis">slope</em> of the cost line, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s03_s01_f02">Figure 7.15 "An Example of a Cost Function"</a>.</p>

            <p class="para">This graph illustrates the cost function for a firm. In this case, the cost function has the equation cost = 50 + 10 × quantity. The cost of producing each additional unit (the marginal cost) is $10.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s03_s01_p04">To emphasize again, <em class="emphasis">only those costs that change matter for a firm’s pricing decision</em>. When a firm considers producing extra output, many of its costs do not change. We can completely ignore these costs when thinking about optimal pricing. This is not to say that other costs don’t matter; quite the contrary. They are critical for a different decision—whether the firm should be in business at all.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn07_007">See <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch09#cooperecon-ch09">Chapter 9 "Growing Jobs"</a>.</span> But as long as we are interested in pricing, we can ignore them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s03_s01_p05">The costs for developing pharmaceutical products are typically quite high. The drug that Ellie was responsible for was first developed in research laboratories, then tested on animals, and then run through a number of clinical studies on human patients. These studies were needed before the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, and equivalent drug safety organizations in other countries, would approve the drug for sale. But these development costs have no effect on marginal cost because they were all incurred before a single pill could be sold.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s03_s01_p06">Surprisingly, this means that even though the drug was very expensive to develop, Ellie’s team—quite correctly—paid no attention to that fact. In determining what price to set, they looked at the price sensitivity of their customers and at marginal cost. They understood that the development costs of the drug were not relevant to the pricing decision. In fact, Ellie’s team had only a very vague idea how much the drug had cost to develop: after all, that development had been carried out by a completely different arm of the company in other parts of the world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s03_s01_p07">You will often hear the opposite argument. It is common for people to say that pharmaceutical companies charge high prices because it costs so much to develop their drugs. This argument is superficially appealing, but it is completely backward. Pharmaceutical companies don’t charge high prices because they incur large development costs. They are willing to incur large development costs because they can charge high prices.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Estimating Marginal Cost</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s03_s02_p01">Estimating marginal cost is generally much easier than estimating demand because the cost side of the business is largely under the control of the firm. The firm’s costs depend on its technology and the decisions made about using that technology. In most medium- or large-sized firms, there is an “operations department” that takes care of the production process. The marketing manager ought to be able to consult with her colleagues in operations and learn about the costs of the firm. Most importantly, even if it is unreasonable to expect an operations manager to know the firm’s entire cost function, the operations manager should have a good idea about marginal cost (that is, should know how much it would cost per unit to scale up operations by a small amount). And that is the information the marketing manager needs for her pricing decisions.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_p02">Let us review the ideas we have developed in this chapter. We know that changes in output lead to changes in both revenues and costs. Changes in revenues and costs lead to changes in profits (see <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s04_f01">Figure 7.16 "Changes in Revenues and Costs Lead to Changes in Profits"</a>). We have a measure of how much revenues change if output is increased—called marginal revenue, which you can calculate if you know price and the elasticity of demand. We also have a measure of how much costs change if output is increased—this is called marginal cost. Given information on current marginal revenue and marginal cost, a marketing manager can then decide if a firm should change its price. In this section, we derive a rule that tells us how a manager should make this decision.</p>

        <p class="para">When a firm changes its price, this leads to changes in revenues and costs. The change in a firm’s profit is equal to the change in revenue minus the change in cost—that is, the change in profit is marginal revenue minus marginal cost. When marginal revenue equals marginal cost, the change in profit is zero, so a firm is at the top of the profit hill.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_p03">In the real world of business, firms almost always choose the price they set rather than the quantity they produce. Yet the pricing decision is easier to analyze if we think about it the other way round: a firm choosing what quantity to produce and then accepting the price implied by the demand curve. This is just a matter of convenience: a firm chooses a point on the demand curve, and it doesn’t matter if we think about it choosing the price and accepting the implied quantity or choosing the quantity and accepting the implied price (<a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s04_f02">Figure 7.17 "Setting the Price or Setting the Quantity"</a>).</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_p04">Suppose that a marketing manager has estimated the elasticity of demand, looked at the current price, and used the marginal revenue formula to discover that the marginal revenue is $5. This means that if the firm increases output by one unit, its revenues will increase by $5. The marketing manager has also spoken to her counterpart in operations, who has told her that the marginal cost is $3. This means it would cost an additional $3 to produce one more unit. From these two pieces of information, the marketing manager knows that an increase in output would be a good idea. An increase in output leads to a bigger increase in revenues than in costs. As a result, it leads to an increase in profits: specifically, profits will increase by $2. This tells the marketing manager that it is a good idea to increase output. From the law of demand, she should think about decreasing the price.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_p05"><a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s04_f03">Figure 7.18 "Optimal Pricing"</a> shows this idea graphically. To the left of the point marked “profit-maximizing quantity,” marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost. Suppose a firm is producing below this level. If it increases its output, the extra revenue it obtains will exceed the extra cost. We see that an increase in output yields extra revenue equal to the areas <em class="emphasis">A</em> + <em class="emphasis">B</em> and extra costs equal to <em class="emphasis">B</em>. The increase in output yields extra profit, which is equal to <em class="emphasis">A</em>. Increasing its output is thus a good idea. Conversely, to the right of the profit-maximizing point, marginal revenue is less than marginal cost. If a firm reduces its output, the decrease in costs (<em class="emphasis">C</em> + <em class="emphasis">D</em>) exceeds the decrease in revenue (<em class="emphasis">D</em>). Decreases in output lead to increases in profit.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s01_p01">Think about Ellie’s company. If it became more expensive for the company to produce each pill, it seems likely they would respond by raising their costs. Also, we said earlier that their customers are not very sensitive to changes in the price, which should allow them to set a relatively high price. In other words, the profit-maximizing price is related to the elasticity of demand and to marginal cost. These are the two critical ingredients of the pricing decision.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s01_l01">

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s01_p05">Ellie’s team looked at their numbers. At the current price, −(elasticity of demand) = 1.47. They learned that the marginal cost was $0.28 per pill, and they were charging $0.50 per pill. Their current markup, in other words, was about 79 percent: 0.5 = (1+ 0.79) × 0.28. But if they applied the markup pricing formula based on the <em class="emphasis">current</em> elasticity of demand, they could charge a markup of 1/0.47 = 2.12—that is, more than a 200 percent markup, leading to a price of $0.87. It was clear that they could do better by increasing their price</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">A Pricing Algorithm</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s02_p01">To summarize, a manager needs two key pieces of information when determining price:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Marginal cost.</strong> We have shown that the profit-maximizing price is a markup over the marginal cost of production. If a manager does not know the magnitude of marginal cost, she is missing a critical piece of information for the pricing decision.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Elasticity of demand.</strong> Once a manager knows marginal cost, she should then set the price as a markup over marginal cost. But this should not be done in an ad hoc manner; the markup must be based on information about the elasticity of demand.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s02_p02">Given these two pieces of information, a manager can then use the markup formula to determine the optimal price. Be careful, though. The markup formula looks deceptively simple, as if it can be used in a “plug-and-play” manner—given marginal cost and the elasticity of demand, plug them into the formula and calculate the optimum price. But if you change the price, both marginal cost and the elasticity of demand are also likely to change. A more reliable way of using this formula is in the algorithm shown in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s04_s02_f01">Figure 7.19 "A Pricing Algorithm"</a>, which is based on our earlier idea that you should find your way to the top of the profit hill. The five steps are as follows:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s02_l02">
            <li>At your current price, estimate marginal cost and the elasticity of demand.</li>
            <li>Calculate the optimal price based on those values.</li>
            <li>If the optimal price is greater than your actual price, increase your price. Then estimate marginal cost and the elasticity again and repeat the process.</li>
            <li>If the optimal price is less than your actual price, decrease your price. Then estimate marginal cost and the elasticity again and repeat the process.</li>
            <li>If the current price is equal to this optimal price, leave your price unchanged.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s02_p03">Ellie’s team members were aware that, even though demand for the drug was apparently not very sensitive to price, they should not immediately jump to a much higher markup. They had found that <em class="emphasis">based on current marginal cost and elasticity</em>, the price could be raised. But as they raised the price, they knew that the elasticity of demand would probably also change. Looking more closely at their market research data, they found that at a price of $0.56 (a 100 percent markup), the elasticity of demand would increase to about 2. An elasticity of 2 means that the markup should be 100 percent to maximize profits. Thus—at least if their market research data were reliable—they knew that a price of $0.56 would maximize profits. Ellie recommended to senior management that the price of the drug be raised by slightly over 10 percent, from $0.50 per pill to $0.56 per pill.</p>

    <div class="section" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Shifts in the Demand Curve Facing a Firm</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s03_p01">So far we have looked only at <em class="emphasis">movements along</em> the demand curve—that is, we have looked at how changes in price lead to changes in the quantity that customers will buy. Firms also need to understand what factors might cause their demand curve to shift. Among the most important are the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Changes in household tastes.</strong> Starting around 2004 or so, low-carbohydrate diets started to become very popular in the United States and elsewhere. For some companies, this was a boon; for others it was a problem. For example, companies like Einstein Bros. Bagels or Dunkin’ Donuts sell products that are relatively high in carbohydrates. As more and more customers started looking for low-carb alternatives, these firms saw their demand curve shift inward.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Business cycle.</strong> Consider Lexus, a manufacturer of high-end automobiles. When the economy is booming, sales are likely to be very good. In boom times, people feel richer and more secure and are more likely to purchase a luxury car. But if the economy goes into recession, potential car buyers will start looking at cheaper cars or may decide to defer their purchase altogether. Many companies sell products that are sensitive to the state of the business cycle. Their demand curves shift as the economy moves from boom to recession.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Changes in competitors’ prices.</strong> In a business setting, this is a critical concern. If a competitor decreases its price, this means that the demand curve you face will shift inward. For example, suppose that British Airways decides to decrease its price for flights from New York to London. American Airlines will find that its demand curve for that route has shifted inward. Ellie certainly has to worry about this because her company’s product has only a small number of competitors. A change in price of a competing blood pressure drug might make a big difference in the sales and profits of Ellie’s product.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s03_p02">If the demand curve shifts, should a firm change its price? The answer is yes <em class="emphasis">if the shift in the demand curve also leads to a change in the elasticity of demand</em>. In practice, this is likely to be the case, although it is certainly possible for a demand curve to shift without a change in the elasticity of demand. The correct response to a shift in the demand curve is to reestimate the elasticity of demand and then decide if a change in price is appropriate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Complications</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s04_p01">Pricing is a difficult and delicate job, and there are many factors that we have not yet considered:<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn07_009">We address some of them in other chapters of the book; others are topics for more advanced classes in economics and business strategy.</span></p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s04_s04_l01">
            <li>By far the most important problem that we have neglected is as follows: When making pricing decisions, <em class="emphasis">firms may need to take into account how other firms will respond to their decisions</em>. For example, a manager might estimate her firm’s elasticity of demand and marginal cost and determine that she could make more money by decreasing price. That calculation presumes that competing firms keep their prices unchanged. In markets with a small number of competitors, it is instead quite likely that other firms would respond by decreasing their prices. This would cause a firm’s demand curve to shift inward and probably leave it worse off than before.</li>
            <li>We have assumed throughout that a firm has to charge the same price for every unit that it sells. In many cases, this is an accurate description of pricing behavior. When a grocery store posts a price, that price holds for every unit on the shelf. But sometimes firms charge different prices for different units—by either charging different prices to different customers or offering individual units at different prices to the same customer. You have undoubtedly encountered examples. Firms sometimes offer quantity discounts, so the price is lower if you buy more units. Sometimes they offer discounts to certain groups of customers, such as cheap movie tickets for students. We could easily fill an entire chapter with other examples—some of which are remarkably sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Firms can have pricing strategies that call for the price to change over time. For example, firms sometimes engage in a strategy known as penetration pricing, whereby they start off by charging a low price in an attempt to develop or expand the market. Imagine that Kellogg’s develops a new breakfast cereal. It might decide to offer the cereal at a low price to induce people to try the product. Only after it has developed a group of loyal customers would it start setting their prices according to the markup principle.</li>
            <li>Pricing plays a role in the overall marketing and branding strategy of a firm. Some firms position themselves in the marketplace as suppliers of high-end offerings. They may choose to set high prices for their products to ensure that customers perceive them appropriately. Consider a luxury hotel that is contemplating setting a very low price in the off-season. Even though such a strategy might make sense in terms of its profits at that time, it might do long-term damage to the hotel’s reputation. For various reasons, customers often use the price of a product as an indicator of that product’s quality, so a low price can adversely affect a firm’s image.</li>
            <li>Psychologists who study marketing have found that demand is sensitive at certain price points. For example, if a firm increases the price of a product from $99.98 to $99.99, there might be very little effect on demand. But if the price increases from $99.99 to $100.00, there might be a much bigger effect because $100.00 is a psychological barrier. Such consumer behavior does not seem completely rational, but there is little doubt that it is a real phenomenon.</li>
            <li>Throughout this chapter, we have said that there is no difference between a firm choosing its price and taking as given the implied quantity or choosing its quantity and taking as given the implied price. Either way, the firm is picking a point on the demand curve. This is true, but there is a footnote that we should add. A firm’s demand curve depends on what its competitors are doing and, oddly enough, it <em class="emphasis">does</em> make a difference if those competitors are choosing quantities or prices.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn07_010">See <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch15#cooperecon-ch15">Chapter 15 "Busting Up Monopolies"</a> for discussion of this. We should also note that firms often do not know their demand curves with complete certainty. Suppose, for example, that the true demand curve for a firm’s product is actually further outward than a firm expects. If the firm sets the price, it will end up with an unexpectedly large quantity being demanded. If the firm sets the quantity, it will end up with an unexpectedly high price.</span>
</li>
            <li>We have focused our attention on the market power of firms as sellers, as reflected in the downward-sloping demand curves they face. Firms can also have market power as buyers. Walmart is such an important customer for many of its suppliers that it can use its position to negotiate lower prices for the goods it buys. Governments are also often powerful buyers and may be able to influence the prices they pay for goods and services. For example, government-run health-care systems may be able to negotiate favorable prices with pharmaceutical companies.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s05_p02">In this chapter, we have paid a great deal of attention to demand, but we have not spoken of supply. There is a good reason for this: a firm with market power does not have a supply curve. A supply curve for a firm tells us how much output the firm is willing to bring to market at different prices. But a firm with market power looks at the demand curve that it faces and then chooses a point on that curve (a price and a quantity). Price, in this chapter, is something that a firm chooses, not something that it takes as given. What is the connection between our analysis in this chapter and a <strong class="emphasis bold">market supply curve</strong>?</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Perfectly Competitive Markets</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s05_s01_p01">If you produce a good for which there are few close substitutes, you have a great deal of market power. Your demand curve is not very elastic: even if you charge a high price, people will be willing to buy the good. On the other hand, if you are the producer of a good that is very similar to other products on the market, then your demand curve will be very elastic. If you increase your price even a little, the demand for your product will decrease a lot.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s05_s01_p02">The extreme case is called a perfectly <strong class="emphasis bold">competitive market</strong>. In a perfectly competitive market, there are numerous buyers and sellers of exactly the same good. The standard examples of perfectly competitive markets are those for commodities, such as copper, sugar, wheat, or coffee. One bushel of wheat is the same as another, there are many producers of wheat in the world, and there are many buyers. Markets for financial assets may also be competitive. One euro is a perfect substitute for another, one three-month US treasury bill is a perfect substitute for another, and there are many institutions willing to buy and sell such assets.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s05_s01_p04">An individual seller in a competitive market has no control over price. If the seller tries to set a price above the going market price, the quantity demanded falls to zero. However, the seller can sell as much as desired at the market price. When there are many sellers producing the same good, the output of a single seller is tiny relative to the whole market, and so the seller’s supply choices have no effect on the market price. This is what we mean by saying that the seller is “small.” It follows that a seller in a perfectly competitive market faces a demand curve that is a horizontal line at the market price, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s05_s01_f01">Figure 7.20 "The Demand Curve Facing a Firm in a Perfectly Competitive Market"</a>. This demand curve is <em class="emphasis">infinitely elastic</em>: −(elasticity of demand) = ∞. Be sure you understand this demand curve. As elsewhere in the chapter, it is the <em class="emphasis">demand faced by an individual firm</em>. In the background, there is a market demand curve that is downward sloping in the usual way; the market demand and market supply curves together determine the market price. But an individual producer does not experience the market demand curve. The producer confronts an infinitely elastic demand for its product.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s05_s01_p05">Everything we have shown in this chapter applies to a firm facing such a demand curve. The seller still picks the best point on the demand curve. But because the price is the same everywhere on the demand curve, picking the best point means picking the best quantity. To see this, go back to the markup formula. When demand is infinitely elastic, the markup is zero:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s05_s01_p06">so price equals marginal cost:</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">price = (1 + markup) × marginal cost = marginal cost.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s05_s01_p07">This makes sense. The ability to set a price above marginal cost comes from market power. If you have no market power, you cannot set a price in excess of marginal cost. A perfectly competitive firm chooses its level of output so that its marginal cost of production equals the market price.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s05_s01_p08">We could equally get this conclusion by remembering that</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s05_s01_p09">and that when −(elasticity of demand) is infinite, marginal revenue equals price. If a competitive firm wants to sell one more unit, it does not have to decrease its price to do so. The amount it gets for selling one more unit is therefore the market price of the product, and the condition that marginal revenue equals marginal cost becomes</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s05_s01_p10">For the goods and services that we purchase regularly, there are few markets that are truly perfectly competitive. Often there are many sellers of goods that may be very close substitutes but not absolutely identical. Still, many markets are close to being perfectly competitive, in which case markup is very small and perfect competition is a good approximation.</p>

The supply curve tells us how much the firm will produce at different prices. Suppose, for example, that the price is $20. At this price, we draw a horizontal line until we reach the marginal cost curve. At that point, we draw a vertical line to the quantity axis. In this way, you can find the level of output such that marginal cost equals price. Looking at the figure, we see that the firm should produce 3 units because the marginal cost of producing the third unit is $20. When the price is $30, setting marginal cost equal to price requires the firm to produce 5.5 units. When the price is $40, setting marginal cost equal to price requires the firm to produce 8 units.</p>

        <h3 class="title">In Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch07_s06_p01">Choosing the right price is one of the hardest problems that a manager faces. It is also one of the most consequential: few other decisions have such immediate impact on the health and success of a firm. It is hardly surprising that firms devote considerable resources to deciding on the price to set. Even though firms operate in many different market settings, our analysis of markup pricing is very general: it applies to firms in all sorts of different circumstances. It is thus a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of firms in an economy.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch07_s06_p02">One goal of this textbook is to help you make good decisions, both in your everyday life and in your future careers. In this chapter, we have set out the principles of how prices <em class="emphasis">should</em> be set, assuming that the goal of a manager is to make as much profit for a firm as possible. It does not necessarily follow, however, that this is how managers actually behave in real life. Does this chapter just describe a make-believe world of economists or does it also describe how prices are set in the real business world?</p>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch07_s06_p03">The answer is a bit of both. Managers must think carefully about costs and demand when setting prices. Market research firms routinely investigate consumers’ price sensitivities and estimate elasticities. At the same time, pricing decisions are sometimes more haphazard than this chapter might suggest. In practice, managers often use rules of thumb or standard markups that are not necessarily solidly based on the elasticity of demand.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch07_s06_p04">There is one reason to think that managers do not stray too far from the prices that maximize their firms’ profits, however. Business is a competitive affair, and firms that make poor decisions will often not survive in the marketplace. If a firm consistently sets the wrong price, it will make less money than its competitors and will probably be forced out of business or taken over by another firm that can do a better job of management. The marketplace imposes a harsh discipline on badly managed firms, but the end result is—usually at least—a more efficient and better-functioning economy.</p>
