    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_p02">A firm’s revenues are the money that it earns from selling its product. Revenues equal the number of units that a firm sells times the price at which it sells each unit:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_p03">For example, think about a music store selling CDs. Suppose that the firm sells 25,000 CDs in a month at $15 each. Then its total monthly revenues are as follows:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_p04">There are two ways in which firms can obtain higher revenues: sell more products or sell at a higher price. So if a firm wants to make a lot of revenue, it should sell a lot of its product at a high price. Then again, you probably do not need to study economics to figure that out. The problem for a manager is that her ability to sell a product is limited by what the market will bear. Typically, we expect that if she sets a higher price, she will not be able to sell as much of the product:</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Demand Curve Facing a Firm</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s01_p01">There will typically be more than one firm that serves a market. This means that the overall demand for a product is divided among the different firms in the market. We have said nothing yet about the kind of “market structure” in which a firm is operating—for example, does it have a lot of competitors or only a few competitors? Without delving into details, we cannot know exactly how the market demand curve will be divided among the firms in the market. Fortunately, we can put this problem aside—at least for this chapter.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn07_003">We look at market structure in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch15#cooperecon-ch15">Chapter 15 "Busting Up Monopolies"</a>.</span> For the moment, it is enough just to know that each firm faces a demand curve for its own product.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s01_p02">When the price of a product increases, individual customers are less likely to think it is good value and are more likely to spend their income on other things instead. As a result—for almost all products—a higher price leads to lower sales.</p>

            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s01_p03">The demand curve facing a firm tells us the price that a firm can expect to receive for any given amount of output that it brings to market or the amount it can expect to sell for any price that it chooses to set.

For example, with this demand curve, if a manager sets the price at $10, the firm will sell 50 units because 100 − (5 × 10) = 50. If a manager sets the price at $16, the firm will sell only 20 units: 100 − (5 × 16) = 20. For every $1 increase in the price, output decreases by 5 units. (We have chosen a demand curve with numbers that are easy to work with. If you think that this makes the numbers unrealistically small, think of the quantity as being measured in, say, thousands of units, so a quantity of 3 in this equation means that the firm is selling 3,000 units. Our analysis would be unchanged.)</p>

Alternatively, the firm can sell a large quantity (for example, 80), but only if it is willing to accept a low price ($4). The hard choice embodied in the demand curve is perhaps the most fundamental trade-off in the world of business. Of course, if the firm sets its price too high, it won’t sell anything at all. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">choke price</a><span class="glossdef">The price above which no units of the good will be sold.</span></span> is the price above which no units of the good will be sold.

They know that if they set a higher price, they can expect to sell less output. But this is not enough information for good decision making. Managers need to know whether their customers’ demand is very sensitive or relatively insensitive to changes in the price.

For example, De Beers controls much of the world’s market for diamonds, and other firms are not easily able to provide substitutes. Thus the demand for De Beers’ diamonds tends to be insensitive to price. We say that De Beers has a lot of market power. By contrast, a fast-food restaurant in a mall food court possesses very little market power: if the fast-food Chinese restaurant were to try to charge significantly higher prices, most of its potential customers would choose to go to the other Chinese restaurant down the aisle or even to eat sushi, pizza, or burritos instead.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s02_p02">Ellie’s company had significant market power. There were a relatively small number of drugs available in the country to treat high blood pressure, and not all drugs were identical in terms of their efficacy and side effects. Some doctors were loyal to her product and would almost always prescribe it. Some doctors were not very well informed about the price because doctors don’t pay for the medication. For all these reasons, Ellie had reason to suspect that the demand for her drug was not very sensitive to price.</p>

In other words, the market power of a firm is not constant: it depends on the price that a firm has chosen to set. To illustrate, remember that we found −(elasticity of demand) = 3 for our demand curve when the price is $15. Suppose we calculate the elasticity for this same demand curve at $4. Thus imagine that that we are originally at the point where the price is $4 and sales are 80 units and then suppose we again decrease the price by 20 cents. Sales will increase by 1 unit:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p01">To evaluate the effects of her decisions on revenues, Ellie needs to know about the demand curve facing her firm. In particular, she needs to know whether the quantity demanded by buyers is very sensitive to the price that she sets. We now know that the elasticity of demand is a useful measure of this sensitivity. How can managers such as Ellie gather information on the elasticity of demand?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p02">At an informal level, people working in marketing and sales are likely to have some idea of whether their customers are very price sensitive. Marketing and sales personnel—if they are any good at their jobs—spend time talking to actual and potential customers and should have some idea of how much these customers care about prices. Similarly, these employees should have a good sense of the overall market and the other factors that might affect customers’ choices. For example, they will usually know whether there are other firms in the market offering similar products, and, if so, what prices these firms are charging. Such knowledge is much better than nothing, but it does not provide very concrete evidence on the demand curve or the elasticity of demand.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p03">A firm may be able to make use of existing sales data to develop a more concrete measure of the elasticity of demand. For example, a firm might have past sales data that show how much they managed to sell at different prices, or a firm might have sales data from different cities where different prices were charged. Suppose a pricing manager discovers data for prices and quantities like those in part (a) of <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_f01">Figure 7.8 "Finding the Demand Curve"</a>. Here, each dot marks an observation—for example, we can see that in one case, when the price was $100, the quantity demanded was 28.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p04">The straight-line demand curves that appear in this and other books are a convenient fiction of economists and textbook writers, but no one has actually seen one in captivity. In the real world of business, demand curves—if they are available at all—are only a best guess from a collection of data. Economists and statisticians have developed statistical techniques for these guesses. The underlying idea of these techniques is that they <em class="emphasis">fit a line</em> to the data. (The exact details do not concern us here; you can learn about them in more advanced courses in economics and statistics.) Part (b) of <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_f01">Figure 7.8 "Finding the Demand Curve"</a> shows an example. It represents our best prediction, based on available data, of how much people will buy at different prices.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p05">If a firm does not have access to reliable existing data, a third option is for it to generate its own data. For example, suppose a retailer wanted to know how sensitive customer demand for milk is to changes in the price of milk. It could try setting a different price every week and observe its sales. It could then plot them in a diagram like <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_f01">Figure 7.8 "Finding the Demand Curve"</a> and use techniques like those we just discussed to fit a line. In effect, the store could conduct its own experiment to find out what its demand curve looks like. For a firm that sells over the Internet, this kind of experiment is particularly attractive because it can randomly offer different prices to people coming to its website.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p06">Finally, firms can conduct market research either on their own or by hiring a professional market research firm. Market researchers use questionnaires and surveys to try to discover the likely purchasing behavior of consumers. The simplest questionnaire might ask, “How much would you be willing to pay for product x?” Market researchers have found such questions are not very useful because consumers do not answer them very honestly. As a result, research firms use more subtle questions and other more complicated techniques to uncover consumers’ willingness to pay for goods and services.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p07">Ellie decided that she should conduct market research to help with the pricing decision. She hired a market research firm to ask doctors about how they currently prescribed different high blood pressure medications. Specifically, the doctors were asked what percentage of their prescriptions went to each of the drugs on the market. Then they were asked the effect of different prices on those percentages. Based on this research, the market research firm found that a good description of the demand curve was as follows:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">quantity demanded = 252 − 300 × price.</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p08">Remember that the drug was currently being sold for $0.50 a pill, so</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">quantity demanded = 252 − 300 × 0.5 = 102.</span></span>
            <p class="para block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s02_s04_p09">The demand curve also told Ellie that if she increased the price by 10 percent to $0.55, the quantity demanded would decrease to 87 (252 − 300 × 0.55 = 87).

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_p01">The next step is to understand how to use the demand curve when setting prices. The elasticity of demand describes how quantity demanded depends on price, but what a manager really wants to know is how <em class="emphasis">revenues</em> are affected by price. Revenues equal price times quantity, so we know immediately that a firm earns $0 if the price is $0. (It doesn’t matter how much you give away, you still get no money.) We also know that, at the choke price, the quantity demanded is 0 units, so its revenues are likewise $0. (If you sell 0 units, it doesn’t matter how high a price you sell them for.) At prices between $0 and the choke price, however, the firm sells a positive amount at a positive price, thus earning positive revenues. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_f01">Figure 7.9 "Revenues"</a> is a graphical representation of the revenues of a firm.

This is shown in the figure as the rectangle labeled “revenues lost.” But the firm will sell more units: from the demand curve, we know that when the firm decreases its price by $0.20, it sells another unit. That means that the firm gains $14.80, as shown in the shaded area labeled “revenues gained.” The overall change in the firm’s revenues is equal to $14.80 − $5.00 = $9.80.

            <ol class="orderedlist block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_s02_l01">
                <li>Marginal revenue is always less than the price.

If the price stays the same, then the extra revenue would just equal the price. But the price does not stay the same: it decreases, meaning the firm gets less for every unit that it sells.</li>
                <li>Marginal revenue can be negative. If –(elasticity of demand) &lt; 1, then <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="fwk-cooperecon-07_m0020" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mtext>1</mtext><mrow><mo>−</mo><mtext>(elasticity of demand)</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac><mo>&gt;</mo><mtext>1,</mtext> </mrow>  </semantics></math></span> and <span class="inlineequation"><math xml:id="fwk-cooperecon-07_m0021" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><mfrac><mtext>1</mtext><mrow><mo>−</mo><mtext>(elasticity of demand)</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow><mo>&lt;</mo><mtext>0</mtext><mtext>.</mtext> </mrow>  </semantics></math></span> When marginal revenue is negative, increased production results in <em class="emphasis">lower</em> revenues for a firm. The firm sells more output but loses more from the lower price than it gains from the higher sales.</li>
                <li>The gap between marginal revenue and price depends on the elasticity of demand. When demand is more elastic, meaning −(elasticity of demand) is a bigger number, the gap between marginal revenue and price becomes smaller.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_s02_p03">These three ideas are illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_s02_f01">Figure 7.12 "Marginal Revenue and Demand"</a>. The demand curve shows us the price at any given quantity. The marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve because of our first observation: at any quantity, marginal revenue is less than price.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn07_006">When a demand curve is a straight line, the marginal revenue curve is also a straight line with the same intercept, but it is twice as steep.</span> The marginal revenue curve intersects the horizontal axis at 50 units: when output is less than 50 units, marginal revenue is positive; when output exceeds 50, marginal revenue is negative. We explained earlier that a linear demand curve becomes more inelastic as you move down it. When the demand curve goes from being relatively elastic to relatively inelastic, marginal revenue goes from being positive to being negative.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_s02_p05">What does this mean? Starting at $15, it means that if a firm decreases its price—and hence increase its output—by a small amount, there would be an increase in the firm’s revenues.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_s02_p06">When revenues are at their maximum, marginal revenue is zero. We can confirm this by calculating the elasticity of demand at $10. Consider a 10 percent increase in price, so the price increases to $11. At $10, sales equal 50 units. At $11, sales equal 45 units. In other words, sales decrease by 5 units, so the decrease in sales is 10 percent. It follows that</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_s02_p08">At $10, a small change in price leads to no change in revenue. The benefit from selling extra output is exactly offset by the loss from charging a lower price.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_s02_p09">We can thus divide the demand curve into two parts, as in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_s02_f02">Figure 7.13 "Marginal Revenue and the Elasticity of Demand"</a>. At low quantities and high prices, a firm can increase its revenues by moving down the demand curve—to lower prices and higher output. Marginal revenue is positive. In this region, −(elasticity of demand) is a relatively large number (specifically, it is between 1 and infinity) and we say that the demand curve is relatively elastic. Conversely, at high quantities and low prices, a decrease in price will decrease a firm’s revenues. Marginal revenue is negative. In this region, −(elasticity of demand) is between 0 and 1, and we say that the demand curve is inelastic. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch07_s02_s03_t02" xrefstyle="select:label">Table 7.3</a> represents this schematically.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s04_p01">The market research company advising Ellie made a presentation to her team. The company told them that if they increased their price, they could expect to see a decrease in revenue. At their current price, in other words, marginal revenue was positive. If Ellie’s team wanted to maximize revenue, they would need to recommend a reduction in price: down to the point where marginal revenue is $0—equivalently, where −(elasticity of demand) = 1.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch07_s02_s04_p02">Some members of Ellie’s team therefore argued that they should try to decrease the price of the product so that they could increase their market share and earn more revenues from the sale of the drug. Ellie reminded them, though, that their goal wasn’t to have as much revenue as possible. It was to have as large a <em class="emphasis">profit</em> as possible. Before they could decide what to do about price, they needed to learn more about the costs of producing the drug.</p>
