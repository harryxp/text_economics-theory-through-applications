            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s00_s05_p02">At first reading, these five stories seem to have little to do with each other. There is no obvious connection between the actions of the World Bank in Niger and Taiwanese computer manufacturers in Vietnam or between the marketing of Dubai and the arrival of Polish migrants in the United Kingdom. Yet they are indeed all connected. Think for a moment about the <em class="emphasis">consequences</em> of the following:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s00_s05_l01">
                <li>An influx of workers to the United Kingdom</li>
                <li>A superior business environment in Dubai</li>
                <li>Improved education in Niger</li>
                <li>A new factory opening in Vietnam</li>
                <li>An improved banking system in the United States</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s00_s05_p03">Of course, each story has many different implications. But they have something fundamental in common: every single one of them will increase the real gross domestic product (real GDP) of the country in question. They all therefore shed light on one of the most fundamental questions in macroeconomics:</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s00_s05_bl01">
                <p class="para editable" id="cooperecon-ch20_s00_s05_p04">What determines a country’s real GDP?</p>
            </span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s00_s05_p05">As we tackle this question, we will see that it is indeed connected to our stories of Dubai, the United Kingdom, Niger, Vietnam, and the United States.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch20_s00_s05_p06">Our stories have something else in common as well. In each case, they concern not only the country in isolation but also how it interacts with the rest of the world. The funds for Niger’s education program are coming from other countries (via the World Bank). The US policy is designed to ensure that America is “leading the global competition that will determine our success in the 21st century.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn20_007">“Obama Presses for an Economy in ‘Overdrive’: Will Jobs Soon Follow?,” PBS NewsHour, January 21, 2011, accessed August 22, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/jan-june11/obamabusiness_01-21.html">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/jan-june11/obamabusiness_01-21.html</a>.</span> Dubai is trying to attract investment from other countries. The workers in the United Kingdom are coming from Poland. The factory in Vietnam is being built so that a Taiwanese company can supply other manufacturers throughout the world.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Road Map</h3>
                <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch20_s00_s06_p01">Real GDP is the broadest measure that we have of the amount of economic activity in an economy. In this chapter, we investigate the <em class="emphasis">supply</em> of real GDP in an economy. Firms in an economy create goods and services by transforming inputs into outputs. For example, think about the manufacture of a pizza. It begins with a recipe—a set of instructions. A chef following this recipe might require 30 minutes of labor time to make the dough and assemble the toppings and then might need 15 minutes use of a pizza oven to cook the pizza. The inputs here are as follows: the pizza oven, the labor time, the skills of the chef, and the recipe. Given 15 minutes of capital time, 30 minutes of labor time, a skilled chef, and the instructions, we can make one pizza.</p>
                <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch20_s00_s06_p02">In macroeconomics, we work with the analogous idea that explains how the total production in an economy depends on the available inputs. We first explain the relationship between the available inputs in the economy and the amount of real GDP that the economy can produce. Then we look at all the individual inputs in turn. If we can explain what determines the amount of each input in an economy and if we know the link from inputs to real GDP, then we can determine the level of real GDP. Finally, we look at a technique that allows us to quantify the relationship between inputs and output. Specifically, we look at how increases in different inputs translate into increases in overall GDP. Using this technique, we can see which inputs are particularly important.</p>
