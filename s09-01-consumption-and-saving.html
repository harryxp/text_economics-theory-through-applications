        <h2 class="title editable block">The Budget Line with Two Periods</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_p01">Now think about what the budget line looks like when we are choosing between now and the future. Just as we find it easier to think about the choice between two goods rather than among 2,000 goods, so too is it easier to think about the choice over only two periods of time. We call these two periods “this year” and “next year.” There is nothing special about the two-period example beyond the fact that it makes it easy to draw diagrams and see what is going on. The principles that we uncover for this case also apply to decisions made with more than two time periods in mind.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_p02">We also do not worry about all the different goods and services that are available, preferring instead to talk in general about consumption this year and consumption next year. We <em class="emphasis">aggregate</em> together all the different products that we consume. Thus “consumption” means the bundle of goods and services people consume. This consumption also has an associated price, which we call the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">price level</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of average prices in an economy.</span></span>. Think of this as the average price of goods and services in the economy. If you find it easier, imagine there is a single good, like chocolate bars, that you consume, and think of the price level as simply being the price of a chocolate bar.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Saving and the Nominal Interest Rate</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p01">If you choose not to spend all your income on consumption this year, you are saving. When you save, you can put your money into a financial institution and earn interest on it. Suppose you have $100 this year that you save by putting it in a bank. You are then <em class="emphasis">lending</em> to the bank—saving and lending are really the same thing. The bank acts as an intermediary, taking your $100 and giving it to someone else who borrows from the bank.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p02">The bank offers you interest on this loan—for example, it may pay a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nominal interest rate</a><span class="glossdef">The rate at which individuals and firms in an economy can save or borrow.</span></span> of 5 percent per year. After a year, your bank account will contain your original $100, plus an extra 5 percent. Because 5 percent of $100 is $5, you earn $5 worth of interest. We talk about interest rates in percentage terms, but you should remember that a percentage is simply a number. For example, 5 percent is 0.05, and 20 percent is 0.2. The nominal interest rate is the interest rate at which individuals and firms in the economy can save or borrow.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn05_003">There are actually many different interest rates in an economy. <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch10#cooperecon-ch10">Chapter 10 "Making and Losing Money on Wall Street"</a> looks at some of these. Here, we simplify the process by supposing there is only one interest rate.</span> It is called a <em class="emphasis">nominal</em> interest rate because it is measured in monetary terms. Most interest rates are quoted on an annual basis, meaning that they specify the amount earned per year.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p03">Of course, if you put a $100 in the bank for one year, then next year you will still have the original $100 as well as the interest you earned. At an interest rate of 5 percent, $100 this year is worth $105 next year. To calculate the <em class="emphasis">total</em> amount of money that you can earn, we simply add one to the nominal interest rate, giving us the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nominal interest factor</a><span class="glossdef">A factor, equal to 1 + the nominal interest rate, used to convert dollars today into dollars next year.</span></span>:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p05">The budget line has a negative slope because—as with the choice between chocolate bars and downloads—you must give one thing up to get another.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p06">The slope of the budget line depends not only on the nominal interest factor but also on prices this year and next year. Suppose the price of a unit of consumption this year is $100 and next year it is $110. Economists call the percentage increase in the price level the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inflation rate</a><span class="glossdef">The rate at which the overall price level in an economy is growing.</span></span>; it is calculated as follows:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p07">Put differently, it is the rate of growth of the price level. In our example, the inflation rate is 10 percent.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p08">Now suppose the nominal interest rate is also 10 percent, which means that the nominal interest factor is 1.1. Then</p>

In fact, it depends on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">real interest factor</a><span class="glossdef">A factor, equal to 1 + the real interest rate, that allows you to convert units of goods and services this year into units of goods and services next year.</span></span>:</p>

                <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p10">The real interest rate is the rate of interest adjusted for inflation. It tells you how much you will get next year, <em class="emphasis">in terms of goods and services</em>, if you give up a unit of goods and services this year. The real interest factor allows you to convert units of goods and services this year into units of goods and services next year. The real interest factor is 1 + the real interest rate.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p11">As you move along the budget line in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s01_f01">Figure 5.2 "The Budget Line with Two Periods"</a>, you are giving up chocolate (consumption) this year for chocolate next year. So the slope of the budget line must be a number, not a dollar amount. Because this year’s price and next year’s price are both denoted in dollars, their ratio is a number. Likewise, the interest rate is a number, so the slope of the budget line is indeed a number.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p12">An example may help you understand the difference between the nominal interest rate and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">real interest rate</a><span class="glossdef">The rate of interest adjusted for inflation.</span></span>. Suppose you go to your bank and get a one-year, $20,000 loan to buy a car, with a nominal interest rate of 5 percent. Your contract with the bank thus stipulates that you must pay the bank $21,000 at the end of the year. If the inflation rate is zero, then the cost of borrowing measured in terms of real goods and services is $1,000, which is 5 percent of the amount that you borrowed. But if the inflation rate is 5 percent, then the $21,000 you pay to the bank at the end of the loan buys the same amount of goods and services that the $20,000 the bank lent to you. In this case, you are effectively able to borrow for free.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p13">Good decisions about borrowing and lending are based on real interest rates rather than nominal interest rates. Your cost of borrowing to buy the car is not the monetary payments you make on the loan but rather the value of the goods and services you could have purchased with that money. So we need a way to convert from the commonly observed nominal interest rate to a measure of real interest rates. We do this by using a formula for the real interest rate that was discovered by a famous economist named Irving Fisher.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p01">Interestingly, the timing of your income turns out not to matter for your choice of consumption, which is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s01_s03_s02_f01">Figure 5.6 "The Timing of Income"</a>.</p>

                <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 5.6</span> The Timing of Income</p>
                <img src="section_09/b94408267a819cc97ad90a8765e5fa00.jpg">
                <p class="para">The timing of income is irrelevant to the consumption choice. Here, one individual has low income this year and high income next year, while the opposite is true for the other individual. However, the discounted present value of income is the same in both cases. If they both have the same tastes, they will choose the same consumption point.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p02">Suppose that the nominal interest rate is 10 percent and that the price level is $10 in both periods. This means that the inflation rate is zero, so—from the Fisher equation—the real interest rate is also 10 percent. Now imagine that there are two individuals who have identical tastes. One of them earns income of $40,000 this year and $22,000 next year, so real income (nominal income divided by the price level) is therefore 4,000 this year and 2,200 next year. The other person earns $20,000 this year and $44,000 next year, yielding a real income of 2,000 this year and 4,400 next year. Both of these individuals share the same budget line (see <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s01_s03_s02_f01">Figure 5.6 "The Timing of Income"</a>). This is because the discounted present value of their nominal income is the same: $60,000. (Check to make sure you understand why this is true.) For example, suppose that the preferred point of both individuals is to consume the same amount in each year. Then they can both consume approximately 3,143 units of consumption in each period.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p03">Let us see how this works. Because the price level is $10, this amount of consumption costs $31,430 in each period. The first individual takes her income of $40,000 and saves $8,570 by putting it in the bank. This saving earns 10 percent interest, so she gets an additional $857. She thus has income in the following year equal to $22,000 + $8,570 + $857 = $31,427. This allows her to buy 3,142.7 units of consumption goods. The second individual needs to borrow $11,430 to add to his income this year. Next year, he must repay this amount plus 10 percent interest (that is, another $1,143). So his income next year is $44,000 − $11,430 − $1,143 = $31,427. So one individual must save to reach her preferred consumption bundle, while the other must borrow to reach his. Yet because they have the same discounted present value of income and the same tastes, they will consume the same bundle of goods.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p04">Keep in mind that our discussion so far ignores uncertainty. We assumed that both individuals know their current and future income with certainty. Just as importantly, we have supposed that a bank is confident that the borrower will have sufficient income next year to repay the loan. In a world of uncertainty, we do not know for sure how much money we will have next year, and lenders worry about the possibility that people might not make good on their loans. Later in the chapter, we explain more about decision making in an uncertain world.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Lifetime Budget Constraint</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p01">So far, we have worked everything out in terms of a two-period example. The two-period budget constraint tells us how income and consumption are linked over time. In reality, of course, you make these decisions with longer time horizons, and you can save or borrow for multiple years. But the same fundamental insight holds. If you save this year, then you will have extra resources to spend at some future date. If you borrow this year, then you will have to repay that loan sometime in the future, at which time you will have fewer resources to spend.</p>
        <div class="callout block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_n01">
            <h3 class="title"></h3>
            <p class="simpara">Toolkit: <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch31_s04#cooperecon-ch31_s04" xrefstyle="select:title">Section 31.4 "Choices over Time"</a></p>
            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p02">Individuals face a lifetime budget constraint. They can save in some periods of their lives and borrow (not save) in other periods. Over the course of any individual’s lifetime, however, income and consumption spending must balance. (If you begin life with some assets [for example, a bequest], we count this as part of income. If you leave a bequest when you die, we count this as part of consumption.) The lifetime budget constraint is as follows:</p>
            <span class="informalequation"><span class="mathphrase">discounted present value of lifetime consumption = discounted present value of lifetime income.</span></span>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p03">Again, it is important to be consistent in calculating the discounted present values in this expression. We have written the equation in terms of (real) consumption and (real) income, which means that the real interest factor must be used for discounting. An alternative is to measure both consumption and income in nominal terms and then use the nominal interest factor for discounting. There is a useful special case where real interest rates are zero, in which case it <em class="emphasis">is</em> legitimate simply to add income and consumption in different years. Thus the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lifetime budget constraint</a><span class="glossdef">The discounted present value of lifetime consumption must equal the discounted present value of lifetime income.</span></span> becomes</p>
        <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">total lifetime consumption = total lifetime income.</span></span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p04">Although the principles of decision making are the same whether we are thinking about 2 months, 2 years, or an entire lifetime, it is obviously harder to make decisions over a 30-year horizon than over a 30-day horizon. One reason is that, over longer time horizons, we are more likely to face uncertainty. We don’t know what our income will be 30 years from now, and we don’t know our tastes. But even without that uncertainty, we may not always make good decisions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p05">In particular, economists and psychologists have discovered that we do not view choices involving the near future the same way as we view distant choices. For example, suppose an individual is given a choice between 1 cookie today or 2 cookies tomorrow. If he is impatient (or hungry), he is likely to choose the single cookie today. But if the same individual is given a choice between 1 cookie in 30 days or 2 cookies in 31 days, he or she may very well choose the 2-cookie option. Yet after 30 days have gone by, that person will be confronting the earlier decision, wishing that he or she could have the 2 cookies today.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p06">Another way of saying this is that our decisions are not always consistent over time: our future selves may wish that our current selves had displayed more self-control. For example, we may choose to consume a lot today—instead of saving—and then regret that decision when we are older. Indeed, people often engage in tricks to get around their lack of self-control. For example, some people have a separate bank account for their savings, so they are less tempted to spend that money. Governments also take actions that compensate for our lack of self-control. Social security is in some ways a “forced saving” scheme: the government takes money from us when we are working but pays us money when we are retired.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s04_p07">There is a new and exciting field of economics called “neuroeconomics” that tries to understand the processes in the brain that underlie economic decision making. This field, while still very much in its infancy, promises to help us understand why the economic theory of how we make choices often works well, and why it sometimes does not. Some recent research suggests that different brain processes may deliver conflicting messages when making choices over time. Some processes are deliberative, in line with the economic model, while others are more impulsive. It is likely that the next two decades will bring a much deeper understanding of how the brain makes decisions, perhaps leading to a richer theory of economic decision making.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Changes in Interest Rates</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s05_p01">Whenever the real interest rate changes, then the <em class="emphasis">relative price</em> of consumption this year and next year changes. As we already know, changes in the real interest rate can come from two different sources: changes in the nominal interest rate and changes in the inflation rate. (Look back at the Fisher equation for a reminder of this.) <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s01_s05_f01">Figure 5.7 "An Increase in the Real Interest Rate"</a> shows the effect of an increase in the real interest rate on your budget line. The budget line becomes steeper because the opportunity cost of consumption this year increases. Notice, though, that the point at which you just consume your income in each period is still on the budget line. This is the point at which you are neither saving nor borrowing. Thus no matter what the interest rate, this point is always available to you.</p>

            <p class="para">A change in the real interest rate changes the slope of the budget line. At <em class="emphasis">any</em> real interest rate, however, it is possible to consume exactly one’s income.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s05_p02">Changes in relative prices lead to income and substitution effects. To understand the effect of an increase in the real interest rate, we must look at both effects.</p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Substitution effect.</strong> An increase in the real interest rate makes consumption next year look more attractive relative to consumption this year. This encourages saving and discourages borrowing.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Income effect.</strong> The income effect is somewhat more complicated. Look again at <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch05_s01_s05_f01">Figure 5.7 "An Increase in the Real Interest Rate"</a>. <em class="emphasis">Savers</em> are made better off by an increase in interest rates because, to the left of the income point, the new budget line lies outside the old budget set. This encourages savers to increase consumption this year and next year. Because income this year hasn’t changed, but there is an incentive to consume more this year, we can see that the income effect discourages saving. <em class="emphasis">Borrowers</em>, meanwhile, are worse off by the increase in interest rates. To the right of the income point, the new budget line lies inside the old budget set. This encourages borrowers to decrease consumption this year and next year. This incentive to consume less tells us that the income effect discourages borrowing. In sum, the income effect gives an incentive for savers to save less and for borrowers to borrow less.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch05_s01_s05_p03">Combining the income and substitution effects and following an increase in the interest rate, borrowers have an incentive to borrow less.
