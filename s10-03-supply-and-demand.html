    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_p02">An auction mechanism such as eBay is a natural thing for a seller to use if there are a large number of potential buyers for a good. But what happens if there is also a large number of potential sellers? In this section, we consider what might happen when we have a large number of potential buyers <em class="emphasis">and</em> a large number of potential sellers of a good.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_p03">We have already explained that it is very difficult to analyze what would happen on eBay when there are multiple buyers and sellers, but we can make a better guess about what will happen on a site like craigslist. As a buyer, you will look for the lowest price out there, bargain with sellers who post high prices, or both. As a seller, you would look at the prices posted by others and realize that you probably should set your price fairly close to those prices. In addition, we have some evidence that can help us understand the likely outcome in a world of many buyers and many sellers. It comes from looking at “double oral auctions.” “Double” refers to the fact that there are a large number of buyers and sellers. “Oral” refers to the way in which the auction is conducted.</p>
    <div class="section" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Double Oral Auctions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_s01_p01">In a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">double oral auction</a><span class="glossdef">A large number of buyers and sellers, each with potentially a different valuation of a good, negotiate with each other, one on one, to try to get a better deal.</span></span>, there is a large number of buyers, each of whom potentially has a different valuation of the good. There is also a large number of sellers, each of whom potentially has a different valuation of the good. Buyers and sellers negotiate with each other, one on one. If they cannot agree to a deal, either party can move on at any time and try to find someone else to bargain with.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_s01_p02">Until quite recently, auctions such as this were common in many financial markets and commodity markets. These markets sometimes go by the name <em class="emphasis">pit markets</em> because buyers and sellers meet in a frenzy of activity in a trading area called the pit. Traders can hear and see the negotiations of others and often have access to the prices at which deals have been done. This means that both buyers and sellers have lots of information about what price is prevailing in the market.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn06_009"><a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch10#cooperecon-ch10">Chapter 10 "Making and Losing Money on Wall Street"</a> has much more to say about these markets.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_s01_p03">Economists have also conducted experiments in which they have put people in simulated pit markets to find out how they behave. The result is quite remarkable, but before we explain what happens, we need a framework to help us think about such markets.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Demand: Many Buyers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_s02_p01">Suppose we are considering the purchase of a gaming console by a group of buyers. Each potential buyer has his own valuation. Some might be willing to pay as much as $700. Others might be willing to spend much less. After all, how much you are willing to pay for a gaming console depends on your income, how much you like playing, what equipment you currently own, and so on.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_s02_p02">Each potential buyer has a unit demand curve like the one we saw in <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch06_s01#cooperecon-ch06_s01_s01_f01">Figure 6.3 "The Buyer’s Valuation"</a>. We can add these unit demand curves together to get a picture of demand in the entire market: the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">market demand curve</a><span class="glossdef">The number of units of a good or a service demanded at each price.</span></span>. For example, suppose only one person is willing to buy if the price is $700. However, suppose there is another buyer with a valuation of $660. If consoles were on sale for $660, then both individuals would want to purchase. At $660, in other words, the quantity demanded is 2. Perhaps the buyer with the next-highest valuation is willing to pay $640. If the price is $640, the quantity demanded is 3. <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch06_s03_s02_f01">Figure 6.10 "Obtaining the Market Demand Curve"</a> shows what happens when we add together all these unit demand curves. The result is a downward sloping relationship that shows us how many units would be demanded at any given price.</p>

                <li>Given the equilibrium price, sellers supply the equilibrium quantity.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_s04_p05">The equilibrium outcome is plausible because, at any other price, there will be a mismatch of buyers and sellers. Imagine, by contrast, that the buyers and sellers of our example are currently trading at $600, well above the equilibrium price of $480. At this high price, many more people want to sell than want to buy. Buyers would rapidly realize that they are in a strong bargaining position: if many sellers want your business, you can make them compete with each other and force price decreases. In fact, whenever the price is above equilibrium, the mismatch of buyers and sellers will tend to decrease prices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_s04_p06">By similar reasoning, a price of, say, $400 would also result in a mismatch between buyers and sellers.

            <p class="para" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_s05_p02">Supply and demand is a framework we use to explain and predict the equilibrium price and quantity of a good. This framework illustrates the willingness to sell (market supply) and buy (market demand) on a graph with price on the vertical axis and units of the good or the service on the horizontal axis. A point on the market supply curve shows the quantity that suppliers are willing to sell for a given price. A point on the market demand curve shows the quantity that demanders are willing to buy for a given price. The intersection of supply and demand determines the equilibrium price and quantity that will prevail in the market. A basic supply-and-demand framework is shown in <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch06_s03_s05_f01">Figure 6.13 "Supply and Demand"</a>.</p>

A change in these will cause the entire supply curve to shift. When one (or both) of the curves shifts, the equilibrium price and quantity change.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_s05_p04">Experience with double oral auctions, both in the laboratory and in actual pit markets, tells us that trading will typically settle down close to the equilibrium price within a relatively short period of time.

So every remaining potential buyer has a valuation less than $480. All the sellers with valuations less than $480 have now made a sale. So every potential seller has a valuation greater than $480. It follows that there is no mutually beneficial transaction to be carried out.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_s06_p07">This is a truly remarkable result. A market where all potential buyers and sellers take as given the equilibrium price allows all the possible gains from trade to be realized. Thus a market is a very effective mechanism for generating an efficient allocation of resources. This is why economists place so much emphasis on markets and “market solutions” to economic problems. Markets allow buyers and sellers to come together to make mutually beneficial trades. Economists believe that, as far as possible, we should create circumstances in which people can meet and carry out voluntary transactions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cooperecon-ch06_s03_s06_p08">Although this argument for markets is very powerful, we must be careful. Buyers and sellers may benefit from trading, but sometimes other people not involved in the transaction may also be affected. For example, suppose you fill up your car with gas at your local gas station. Presumably, you benefit from this transaction—otherwise you wouldn’t have bought the gas. Likewise, the gas station owner benefits from the transaction—otherwise the owner wouldn’t have sold it to you. But your purchase will contribute to smog and air pollution when you drive the car, affecting other people in the vicinity. To the extent that you make a contribution to global climate change, your little transaction has the potential to have an effect—a very tiny effect but an effect nonetheless—on everyone else on the planet. As a more positive example, going to college is presumably a mutually beneficial transaction between you and your school. But many others may eventually benefit from your education as well.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-cooperecon-fn06_011">In <a class="xref" href="cooperecon-ch14#cooperecon-ch14">Chapter 14 "Cleaning Up the Air and Using Up the Oil"</a>, we consider such uncompensated costs and benefits in detail.</span></p>

                <li>Look at <a class="xref" href="#cooperecon-ch06_s03_s04_f01">Figure 6.12 "Market Equilibrium"</a>. How could the equilibrium price be greater than $480?</li>
                <li>Suppose there are two buyers. The first has a demand curve given by <em class="emphasis">quantity</em> = 5 − 0.5 × <em class="emphasis">price</em>. The second one has a demand curve of <em class="emphasis">quantity</em> = 15 − 1.5 × <em class="emphasis">price</em>. What is the market demand at $1? Suppose there is a total supply of 10 units in this market. What is the equilibrium price? How is the surplus allocated?</li>
